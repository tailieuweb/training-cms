= Does it work with any WordPress theme? =

Yes, it will work with any WordPress theme as long as you are using WooCommerce and Elementor as a page builder. However, some dynamic elements, such as a product or product category, appear in a different layout that is defined by the theme. Some themes override WooCommerce product styling and this can make some widget options inactive.
