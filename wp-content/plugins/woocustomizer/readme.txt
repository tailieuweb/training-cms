== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will StoreCustomizer work with my theme?
It should ! But as themes can add their own CSS or templates which might affect StoreCustomizer from working perfectly... We're here to help... [Let us know](https://storecustomizer.com/go/contact-us/) if something doesn't work and we'll help you fix it.

= Where are the StoreCustomizer settings?
All the settings for StoreCustomizer are built into the WordPress Customizer. Simply go to **Appearance -> Customize -> StoreCustomizer** and start editing.

= Does StoreCustomizer change my WooCommerce pages?
StoreCustomizer DOES NOT override or change the layout of your WooCommerce pages, your **store pages are designed by the theme that you are using**, StoreCustomizer only adds extra styling on top of the theme and **only to the elements you choose to design**.

= Free vs Premium... How does StoreCustomizer work?
All of the core features offered in StoreCustomizer are completely free... These free features help you to customize and further design your WooCommerce store pages, this is the core focus of the StoreCustomizer plugin... To offer a great free product.

The StoreCustomizer Pro version offers only EXTRA store enhancing features such as turning the store into Catalogue Mode, adding a Menu Cart, building custom WooCommerce thank you pages, adding Ajax Search and more. WooCustomizer DOES NOT offer half of these features and then try to get you to upgrade, it simply advertises what is available in the Pro version to enhance your store, and we offer it all at a great price for all extra features.

Please [contact us](https://storecustomizer.com/go/contact-us/) if something does not work on your site so that we can try and help.

Please [contact us](https://storecustomizer.com/go/contact-us/) so we can post a fix and get it working for you.

This could be from the theme you're using. Again, please [contact us](https://storecustomizer.com/go/contact-us/) so we can post a fix or give you the CSS to fix it.

= Why the name change?
We've found out we're not really allowed to use the "Woo" prefix, so we've changed the name from "WooCustomizer" to the new name... "StoreCustomizer"... and that still describes exactly what the plugin does!
