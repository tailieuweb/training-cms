== WHAT’S INCLUDED IN OUR FREE WOOCOMMERCE PRODUCT FILTER PLUGIN ==

**1. ADD FILTER USING PRODUCT META DATA**
This is an exclusive feature that this free product search plugin provides. Now, you can simply add meta data for your WooCommerce products. You can easily add filters using the custom option in the ‘Filter Settings’ while creating a new filter.


**2. RESPONSIVE DESIGN FOR MOBILE DEVICES**
For the mobile users on your website, the filters will open over a modal window. Users can view all the filters set by you by clicking on the ‘Filters’ button in the frontend. After making the category selections, your customers will have to click the ‘Done’ button. This will filter the targeted products instantly.

**3. FILTER WIDGET FOR ATTRIBUTES IN 5 LAYOUTS**
You can add custom filters in the form of Lists, Labels, Colors (square and round), dropdown, checkbox/ image using this WooCommerce filter plugin.

* Lists- You can display the categories of your products/ services to your customers in list format. This advanced AJAX product filter plugin allows you to enable selecting multiple filters under one attribute. 

* Labels- Using this format, you can display the categories in the horizontal layout. Your customers can select multiple labels at once under this layout as well. When you have fewer categories to label, this format will work best for you.

* Colors- This format is best when you have to display colors instead of writing the name of the colors. You can display your color options in circular or rectangular shapes.

* Dropdown- If your category is very long, you can opt for this format. It will enable your filter in the form of a dropdown menu. Out of these filters, your customers can still select multiple options as per their preference.

* Checkbox- Using the checkbox, you allow your customers to tick the boxes next to the category they want to opt for. This layout also allows the customers to select multiple filters at once. 


**4. DISPLAY SELECTED FILTERS** 
This WordPress WooCommerce filter plugin provides you with 2 options for your users to view the selected filters. You can choose to display them separately with a cross icon by the side of selected options. Another option is to highlight the selected category which is also the default option.

**5. RESET BUTTON FILTER WIDGET** 
This WooCommerce filter plugin allows your customers to reset all the fields they have selected to default. In other words, your customers can deselect all the filters they had initially opted for, by clicking on the reset button.

**6. CUSTOM LOADER**
The custom loader is a crucial component if you have a large number of products on your website. You can apply an icon of your choice for the custom loader. This icon will be the loading icon in your store after the visitors will apply their filters.

**7. SHORTCODES**
WooCommerce Product Filter Plugin also provides appropriate shortcodes to let you place the filter and the reset button appropriately on your product page.

**8. WPML COMPATIBILITY**
The new update of the WooCommerce products filter plugin comes with WPML compatibility. Therefore, feel free to use the same for your global customers.
