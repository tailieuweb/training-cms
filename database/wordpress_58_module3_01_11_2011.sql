The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:29</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The month of November includes the Thanksgiving holiday in my part of the world and in my familial traditions. And one of the things that November always brings up for me is the concept of gratitude. I have a gratitude practice that lasts throughout the year. But this time of year always kind of lets me look outside what makes me feel routinely grateful and explore areas that I don&#8217;t always notice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:05</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, I&#8217;m taking some time to do that in the context of the WordPress project, and it&#8217;s reminded me of one of the foundational things I talk about a lot that may be a little harder for folks to see. I am routinely grateful, of course, for the people who show up to maintain WordPress, the people who keep the back office work going, the contributors who contribute directly to the WordPress CMS and project, the folks who routinely go out and tell other people about WordPress and make sure others know how to use it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s another group that I talk about a lot that is a little harder to grasp. And that&#8217;s this conceptual group of people whose lives have been changed by WordPress. I used to run into people like this all the time when I was organizing WordCamps. And the small but meaningful successes that they share year after year made me realize that my small contribution of organizing these events was really quite valuable; valuable to them, and I assumed also valuable to just other people in the WordPress project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if you&#8217;re contributing in a way that doesn&#8217;t let you have contact with the same users consistently over time, or if contributing doesn&#8217;t quite balance out in your ledger at the moment, it can be hard to put names to faces in a way that lets you see how your contributions are making an impact. To help with that, a few years ago, the WordPress project partnered with the community Marketing team and the HeroPress team to share the People of WordPress series which you can find monthly on wordpress.org/news. For me, this series provides a glimpse into the humanity of the people who use WordPress, and for me, that&#8217;s enough. If all the series ever did was to remind us that WordPress was made for people whose needs matter, that would be enough to continue to have that series forever. But fortunately, the series does quite a bit more than that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The People of WordPress series also lifts up the stories of people who we don&#8217;t always hear from in technology. It highlights the wide array of origin stories that lead people to WordPress. It reminds us of the global nature of what we&#8217;re doing. It reconnects us to the hopefulness of our own first WordPress successes. And it draws a direct line to why we should care about refreshing the commons of this open ecosystem. I&#8217;m sure that there are more things that do as well. But those are just the things off the top of my head, we draw all of the people of WordPress stories that are inside that series directly from the HeroPress essays that have been submitted by users. And I was gonna say users like you in a kind of Reading Rainbow way. But I actually don&#8217;t know if any of you are everyday users who are also using WordPress but maybe not contributing yet. If you are then like I&#8217;m talking to you. And if you&#8217;re not, I&#8217;m probably still talking to you. Because all of these stories that go to HeroPress are very valuable and very important for us to know. Anyway, I digress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:14</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\">Topher DesRosia</a>, who founded HeroPress, is among the first people I met in the community lo these many years ago. And I think the impact that HeroPress has on the WordPress community as a whole is not always well recognized. So in the spirit of expanding the scope of my gratitude, and in the context of refreshing the commons, I would encourage you to head over to HeroPress.com and their newly launched HeroPress Network and see if there&#8217;s any little way that you can contribute to their commons, submitting your story donating to their network offering a small bit of volunteer time if you happen to have any spare time lying around. I know that the team would be delighted to hear from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:01</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That leads us now to our small list of big things. We are about a week away from the feature freeze for WordPress 5.9, the final release of the year. Feature freeze caused a little confusion last time. So I just want to clarify there won&#8217;t be a package released with this milestone. But no more enhancements or features will be worked on at that point. And bug fixing will become the primary focus. That will be on November 9, which I believe is next Tuesday. It&#8217;s definitely next week whenever the calendar turns to nine of November 2021. That&#8217;s the day that we&#8217;re going into feature freeze. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second big thing in our small list of big things is that team rep nomination season is upon us. If you are a team rep or want to learn more about being one, now is the time to kind of look at what&#8217;s going on and how to keep everything moving in that way. I&#8217;ll include a link to the announcement post of that in the notes below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, Daylight Saving Time movements are also upon us. Some parts of the world are ending Daylight Saving Time others are starting it and some have already started or stopped that already.

This month we feature a WordPress e-commerce specialist on the difference it makes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Empowered to make a change</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For WordPress contributor Ronald Gijsel, open source is a lifeline and a perfect place for people with creative minds. It led him on a transformational journey from chef to WordPress e-commerce specialist. Originally from the Netherlands, where he trained in hospitality, he was to find a restorative and energizing power within the WordPress local and global community. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ten years ago, life took a sad turn for Ronald and his wife Nihan when their baby daughter passed away only a few days after she was born. At that time, Ronald was a restaurant owner in the UK, working hard in a challenging economic environment.&nbsp;Discovering open source was in many ways his lifeline and helped him and his wife through their considerable heartache. Through this community, a journey to understand the opportunities of the web and new career paths began.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/ronaldgijsel2-1.jpg?w=632&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Portrait picture of Ronald Gijsel\" class=\"wp-image-11403\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald believes that working together in WordPress and other open source communities can lead to massive benefits for a large number of users. Not least, an online presence has been essential to the survival of many businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During recent years, he has visited open source events worldwide as a partnership manager at a WordPress e-commerce plugin company and community supporter. His enthusiasm for WordPress has steered him to being part of local support, solutions and collaboration as a co-organizer of <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp</a> Bristol, the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Cheltenham-WordPress-Meetup/\">WordPress Cheltenham Meetup</a> and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Moving forward&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When Nihan enrolled in the UK&#8217;s Open University to complete her computer science degree, Ronald found her course materials stirring his own interest. He started to follow the lectures with her and even attempted some of the course work for himself &#8211; all whilst he continued to work as a chef in various local pubs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through this, he discovered how to generate affiliate commission earnings through blogging on different platforms. “Creating websites was slowly becoming a passion. In these first few years, I enjoyed every part of the steep learning curve, from tackling the basics to more advanced coding and designs,” said Ronald.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Start of a Web Career</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald reduced his hours as a chef and devoted more time to online courses learning coding, e-commerce, SEO, and online marketing. Yet when he applied for a job as a WordPress designer, he had only heard of the platform in the context of blogging. This was all to change when an online tutor on one of the training sites revealed the many functions available with WordPress. It was the start of a new career and life journey. This tutor was Topher DeRosia, who went on to create <a href=\"https://heropress.com/\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"467\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/with-topher.jpg?resize=632%2C467&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Ronald Gijsel and Topher De Rosia at \na WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-11398\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/with-topher.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/with-topher.jpg?resize=300%2C222&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/with-topher.jpg?resize=768%2C567&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Ronald with Topher at WordCamp London in 2019</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn WordPress, Ronald ‘binge-watched’ webinars on various development topics and over time he became more familiar with it. Securing a job as a designer was only the beginning of his journey into the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year later in 2015, after landing the job as a WordPress designer, Ronald&#8217;s boss asked him to consider taking on the business and its clients. With his wife, Ronald decided to take on the firm and to expand their work in WordPress e-commerce and online marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an advocate for learning new skills and practicing them, Ronald encourages others to continue to expand their knowledge through study, attending talks at Meetups and WordCamps, and using the new <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress resource</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“WordPress has evolved in so many branches that require different skills. There are hundreds of areas of expertise, roles, and jobs that complement WordPress to make it what it is.”</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"528\" height=\"652\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/meetup3-1.jpg?resize=528%2C652&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Ronald talking about WordPress and e-commerce solutions\" class=\"wp-image-11414 size-full\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/meetup3-1.jpg?w=528&amp;ssl=1 528w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/meetup3-1.jpg?resize=243%2C300&amp;ssl=1 243w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">“WordPress is an essential tool in my box.”<br><em><strong>Ronald Gijsel</strong></em></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald believes WordPress thrives on diversity, with many <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">contributor opportunities</a> and jobs in the ecosystem that require a wide range of skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A big part of this is that each person’s personal background complements their skill sets. Who you are and what you do is influenced by what you have done and learned. We need to cherish this. These things also add to our culture, language, experience, and knowledge,” he said.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A journey into WordPress e-commerce</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/meetup2.jpg?resize=632%2C442&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Ronald presenting on WordPress and e-commerce at an event\" class=\"wp-image-11400\" width=\"632\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/meetup2.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=900%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1800w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/meetup2.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=900%2C630&amp;ssl=1 2700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Ronald shares his enthusiasm for building WordPress and e-commerce websites at WordCamp London in 2019</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald initially extended his interest in the&nbsp;WordPress ecosystem through representing a plugin company at WordCamps in the UK. He became hooked and went on to attend events in many different countries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, he realized he could do more with his connections and create meaningful partnerships. Within a few weeks, he had crafted his dream job and sent a proposal to the CEO of a WordPress e-commerce firm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But pitching to strangers wasn’t an easy task, as he did not know if they would understand his vision. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald said: “The doubts went through my head for months. ‘Do I give up my business and work for the benefit of another company? What if I don’t get on? What do I do with my customers?’ But I decided to take the leap.&#8221; His pitch proved successful, joining his current firm in 2019.<br><br>In the firm’s CEO, Ronald found a mentor, supporter, and a friend. He explained: “Nando Pappalardo never tells me what to do, but instead, he asks questions to make me realize what is achievable, or could be even better. He simply makes suggestions that I read something and reach my own conclusions.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Looking back at the journey&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking risks or changing directions in mid-career often involves a giant leap. In Ronald&#8217;s view, through WordPress, you don&#8217;t need to be alone. He believes its community can offer support and help to process thinking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald said: “I often think back to the moment my daughter passed away. She only lived for a few days. Every day, I wonder how events would have unfolded if she had survived. Maybe her memory lives on in every decision I make and the paths I decide to take.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From his experience, he found that&nbsp;changing a career can sometimes take a few years and have a period of transition. He said: “Only looking back do I realize that each small step slowly made a difference in my life.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“It was WordPress that made the online world easier to navigate and empowered me to make a change”&nbsp;</p><cite>Ronald Gijsel</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “Feeling welcomed into the WordPress community through Meetups and WordCamps added a human dimension and confidence that I can do ‘this’ too.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald’s wish is that his story will offer support to others who may have experienced tragedy in their lives. “I hope that I can give you the hope and strength to try and put your energy into something else that can lead to more significant changes in your life. Try to take it as one positive decision at a time.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help us share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community.&nbsp;Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series.</a>&nbsp;#ContributorStory.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">@</a><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">webcommsat</a>), and Surendra Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\">@sthakor</a>) for the interviews and writing this feature, and to Ronald Gijsel (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/just2ronald/\">@just2ronald</a>) for sharing his story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Meher Bala (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\">@meher</a>), Chloé Bringmann (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\">@cbringmann</a>), Anjana Vasan (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/anjanavasan/\">@anjanavasan</a>), Collieth Clarke (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/callye/\">@callye</a>), and Reyes Martinez (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/rmartinezduque/\">@rmartinezduque</a>) for their content contributions, and Josepha Haden Chomphosy (@<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">chanthaboune</a>), and Topher DeRosia (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\">@topher1kenobe</a>) for their support for the series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This People of WordPress feature is inspired by an essay originally published on </em><a href=\"https://heropress.com/\"><em>HeroPress.com</em></a><em>, a community initiative created by Topher DeRosia.

I&#8217;m your host, Joseph Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today marks the start of Digital Citizenship week. This year in 2021, it is the week of October 18th, and to kick it off, I want to share with you a bit of a lecture that I gave to a college class last week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:55</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An economics professor teaches this class. And so, a little bit, I went to talk about how WordPress is essentially a microcosm of global societies. That was mostly why I was invited to come and give the talk. But one of the students asked a really interesting question about economics, and especially the economics of WordPress. And so, I&#8217;m going to take some time to do my best to answer that question here as well. But first, we&#8217;re going to start with some big picture information about WordPress that I shared with the students, and then maybe you also don&#8217;t necessarily know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first place that we started was with the question of what WordPress is. Most of them had heard of it but didn&#8217;t necessarily have a good handle on what it is. And so this is the definition that I gave to them. This is a bit of each of the facets of WordPress that we kind of see right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, WordPress is, of course, a content management system, which means it&#8217;s a piece of software that uses a copyleft license, which means that it&#8217;s open source, and no one individual necessarily owns the rights to the code. If you get very specific, WordPress is, of course, a FOSS project or a free and open source software project. I know that there are discussions around when a piece of software is free, then what are you using to pay for that piece of software or to pay for your access to that software? And often, the answer is that you&#8217;re using your personally identifying information to pay for something commonly referred to as the data economy. If you&#8217;re not familiar with that, it&#8217;s a little bit of a three-pronged effort there. So you submit your data to get access to the software, or you can join the platform, depending on what it is that you&#8217;re working with. That platform or that software collects your data so that they can build a profile about what sorts of content engages you and so that they can share, essentially, audience cohorts like groups of people that kind of are talking about what you&#8217;re talking about, agree with what you agree about, and find interesting, the same sorts of things that you find interesting. And then those companies sell access to your attention. This is something that I refer to as the attention economy. I think there are a lot of startups at the moment that refers to the attention economy. The most iconic recent example was when the folks over at Netflix said that they weren&#8217;t competing against other streaming services; they were competing against sleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that might ring true for quite a few of us at the moment. But anyway, to scoot us back one level, I had, as I said, WordPress is free software. But the difference with WordPress is that to get a copy of WordPress, you are not necessarily required to hand over any data. You don&#8217;t need to give anyone data to get a copy. You don&#8217;t need to give anyone money or data to open up a copy that you own or to build a website in it if you&#8217;re just doing it locally, but especially around that data side because WordPress is not collecting any data, we&#8217;re also not brokering access to anyone&#8217;s attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another answer to the question of &#8220;What is WordPress?&#8221; WordPress software and the project enable nearly half a trillion dollars of revenue in the global digital economy, as we learned from a recent study from one of the hosting companies inside the WordPress project&nbsp; &#8211; oh, Inside the WordPress ecosystem anyway. And WordPress also runs 42% of the web, with some of the biggest sites we know using WordPress. Such sites like the New York Times, Rolling Stone, many, many others, which you can see in the WordPress showcase as well. I don&#8217;t necessarily want to just like call out all the big groups that use it. But it&#8217;s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;To recap what we just learned about WordPress and what WordPress is. It is software that one uses a copyleft license, meaning no single entity owns it. Two, it is available at no cost, meaning no money changes hands for you to own a copy. Three does not track you, which means that you don&#8217;t have to give WordPress any personally identifying information to get a copy. Four is an enabler of a massive digital economy massive portion of the digital economy even. That, you know, means their services, extensions, themes, plugins, all of that stuff. And five, it is software that supports 42% of the web. Practically every other site you visit uses the software. So that&#8217;s WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this massive free software, you might be thinking to yourself a couple of things. The first thing you might be thinking is, &#8220;Well, that sounds impossible.&#8221; But if that&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re thinking, you may be thinking, &#8220;how is it possible that a software that is technically owned by no one and takes no money or data to obtain &#8211;&nbsp; how is it that a software like that can power 42% of the web.&#8221; This brings me, of course, to a topic that I specialize in, which is how WordPress is made.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is, by now you know, built by a global community of contributors. And it&#8217;s partially contributors that are self-sponsored or giving of their own time freely, and partly sponsored volunteers, people who are paid by Five for the Future initiatives inside various companies. I have said many times, most recently at WordCamp US, that I have an ideal ratio of about two to one in that kind of volunteer or self-sponsored versus corporately sponsored set of voices. And also, as I said, at WordCamp US, we’re not necessarily getting to that ideal ratio right now because of the nature of the way the world is at the moment. However, this community functions almost like a tiny little digital society. There are ways to get your voice heard ways to take on leadership roles; there is a little bit of light governmental structure. And as with any society, any community like this, there&#8217;s a relationship inherent there. There&#8217;s almost a transactional element that takes place when you&#8217;re participating fully. Although I know that for the WordPress project, especially for open source in general, there is a reminder that we should always be contributing without the expectation of reciprocity. But even if you are contributing without the expectation of reciprocity, you still are engaging in an existing community, which means that you are fostering a relationship with the community or with the people who are also participating in the community with you. It&#8217;s just inescapable if you have people around and working together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So two concepts really informed my work to future-proof the WordPress project. And the first one is digital citizenship, which is why this particular WordPress Briefing fits today. And the other is the Tragedy of the Commons, especially how we go about refreshing those commons. So digital citizenship, I talked about it a bit in the last WP Briefing. But it&#8217;s still true today that that&#8217;s important. And the thing that really matters to me as we are working through how to make sure that WordPress is moving forward together. But most discussions of citizenship are location-specific, which makes plenty of sense. However, with so many mobile devices and broader access to some level of internet, we have increasing opportunities to be connected because of interests or skill sets. And even the things that we aspire to or aspire to be with a community like WordPress, which has no home office or main location. Of course, it&#8217;s very important that all of the leaders in WordPress, all of the team reps in WordPress, are proactively engaging with the people in their teams and in their portions of the community instead of waiting for like happenstance running into people. We also use a bunch of social stuff to get people together: twitch screams, not twitch screams because it&#8217;s not that Halloweeny! Twitch streams, hallway hangouts, events that are both online and off. Everything that the Learn section of the community is doing with their discussion groups. There are so many ways that WordPress proactively engages with each other and engages with itself. And that work is all really important to keeping the community involved, which is key to any organization&#8217;s long-term success, and certainly is true for WordPress as long-term success. Because when your community or your organization or your society is engaged and invested in your collective success, then you are (get ready for a list) one, more likely to see obstacles early and be able to overcome them, two more likely to see upcoming trends and prepare for them, three more likely to see what is broken and be able to repair it before it is a major issue. And four, you are more likely to be a resilient and fruitful organization long after any single member has stopped participating.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>11:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more connected to the community you are and the more active, the greater your influence and the ability to affect changes also become. And so, not only is it important for us to remain connected as a community just to make sure that everything is going well. But also, it&#8217;s one of the primary ways that people who are giving back can sort of have more of an opportunity in this particular ecosystem. In open source, anyone can gain influence by helping others by helping the software and by keeping the trains on the tracks. And so, one of the only lasting limits to long-term potential in an open source project is how good you are at seeing beyond yourself and seeing what good action can make beyond just your own benefits. I understand that there are also specific hurdles to contribution in your free time that I have dedicated a couple of different podcasts to, so I don&#8217;t want to neglect that reality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have found in my experience that one of the limiting factors that sometimes cannot be unlearned is not being able to see kind of a broader scope, a broader perspective than what you&#8217;re already bringing into it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So being a good digital citizen, that&#8217;s a really important part of keeping any society together any organization together and moving forward. But especially is in the context of digital citizenship, is true for WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:48</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that is really important to me is this concept of the Tragedy of the Commons, which is, of course, an economics term, open source has borrowed. We have talked about it in this podcast in the past. And today, I specifically am talking about how WordPress works to consistently be refreshing the commons. So the theory of the Tragedy of the Commons says that all societies can withstand a certain volume of free-riders. A certain number of people who reap the benefits of that community’s society without necessarily putting anything back into it. And that is no different in open source than in any other place where you would apply this concept. The particular catch for WordPress is of course, that it is free, freely available and has no specific copyright holder. And so in those circumstances, it is incredibly easy for a small group of people to maintain the software while the whole world uses it for free. And not only is it possible for a small group of people to maintain it, but if you&#8217;re not careful, it&#8217;s also easy for a small group of unpaid people and unacknowledged people to maintain something forever. And at the volume that WordPress operates at, that&#8217;s a really risky choice. It doesn&#8217;t help to support those people; it puts the long-term stability of the software in jeopardy. And at the end of the day, it just does not help to replenish the commons to make sure that everybody keeps getting to have the benefits of this ecosystem in the long term.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>14:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As many of you know, there is this program called Five for the Future. And that program is essentially modeled after a tithe. So the invitation to this program when it was first introduced in 2014 was that if you or your company or your community is made better or made possible by WordPress, you should give back to the WordPress project 5% of your resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is an aspirational 5%, of course, and some groups give back their time while others give back with their money. But almost anyone who wants to give back has some skill that WordPress needs. That particular program has really grown in leaps and bounds since it was introduced. I don&#8217;t know exactly how many team members were considered Five for the Future contributors when it was first introduced in 2014; it was a little before my time. But at the moment, it&#8217;s about 150 people that I am routinely aware of or in contact with, which is still a small number considering how many people use WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, many corporations who have seen the most benefit, including, you know, the company that I work for (Automattic), and a lot of other hosting companies in the ecosystem, all do a really good job of refreshing the commons so that WordPress is still usable for businesses of all levels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>16:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to leave us with one final big picture thought about open source. This is going to be a callback to one of my earliest episodes in this podcast. But I think that it&#8217;s always worth remembering. We&#8217;re going to talk about this really popular phrase in open source projects &#8220;free as in speech, not free as in beer.&#8221; And for WordPress, as you know, it&#8217;s a little bit of both. It&#8217;s literally free. But also, since it&#8217;s open source, it has a free as in speech component to it as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>16:46</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The four freedoms of open source as laid out in the 90s. So 10 years into the open source movement, are basically that you have the freedom to run the program for any purpose, the freedom to study how the program works, and change it so that it can do your computing as you wish, the freedom to redistribute copies so that you can help your neighbor and the freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions, giving the community a chance to learn and benefit from the changes that you put into the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>17:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t remember if I said this in my original podcast, but I&#8217;m going to say it today, free speech has a lot of responsibility, just like being a part of a community. Governments or communities, or in our case, this software is built by the people who show up. For WordPress at 42% of the web, every small choice we make can cause huge changes in how people experience the web today and tomorrow. And that, to my mind, is really no different than participating in any sort of civic infrastructure. The changes that are made today, or the errors that we prevent, set the tone and the circumstance and the potential to thrive for everyone who comes after us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>18:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That leads us into our smallest of big things. I just have a couple of things for you all today. Firstly, at the time of this recording, this is prior to the Go/No-Go demo meeting for WordPress 5.9. So I have no idea what&#8217;s happened. But by the time this podcast has been released, we will have had the Go/No-Go meeting and also have shipped the post that summarizes what happened, what we hope to change in the next essentially sprint so that we can confidently move forward with a clear set of features for the 5.9 release. I will include a link to the notes below in the show notes. Kudos to everyone, props to everyone who participated in that meeting. And also props to all the people who have been helping us as we head into this final release of the year and all of you who are going to help us make it successfully to the end.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>19:15</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing I already kind of alluded to at the top of the podcast, it is Digital Citizenship week; two or three years ago, the WordPress blog had a series about digital citizenship and what it means to be a good digital citizen, what it means to do that in the context of WordPress. I will drop a link to those posts in the show notes as well. They are very well written and very important, and fairly evergreen content. If I think that there is something worth updating, I will update it before putting it in the show notes. And that is your small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>19:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you all for tuning in today for the WordPress sprint. I&#8217;m your host, Joseph Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"11351\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"The Month in WordPress: September 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/10/the-month-in-wordpress-september-2021/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 05 Oct 2021 20:01:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11327\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:351:\"There’s a lot of tolerance in open source software for shipping slightly imperfect work.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. See, here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I want to talk to you a little bit about the digital divide, where it is, maybe a bit of where it&#8217;s headed, and which parts of the WordPress open source project and CMS can help. This is a focused look, though, so I won&#8217;t touch on some of the hurdles that everyone is aware of when you get outside of in-person environments, things like parental modeling or supervision, education on the relevance of technology, etc. This is a follow-up to the conversation that I had at WordCamp US last week—and so doing a little bit of a deeper dive here. And we&#8217;re gonna start with what exactly is the digital divide.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the digital divide is considered those who benefit from the digital age versus those who don&#8217;t; that feels like a really big concept. And the current discussion is primarily about access, or for years that has been about access anyway, especially physical access. So those who have computers versus those who do not have internet in their homes versus those who do not. But I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with that particular, really focused definition of the problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the only problem we see is access, then the solution becomes to get cheap devices and internet to everyone, which certainly has led to more people being connected than ever before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this proliferation of devices that are considered both smart and mobile (mobile in this context, meaning handheld or pocket-sized), the discussion over the last few years has been shifting. It’s been shifting into more of a discussion around the education around the relevance of internet access, discussions around the quality of access to the Internet, and also discussions around Wi-Fi and dial-up and the surprising cost of data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But from my perspective, there are a number of really dangerous assumptions that we make when we boil it all the way down to who has access and the quality of that kind of access.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first dangerous assumption is that we run the risk of conflating being tech-savvy with being digitally literate, and they&#8217;re not really the same things. The second assumption that we run the risk of is assuming that access to cellular data equals access to the internet through any other means. And also assuming that cost is always the determining factor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final fairly dangerous assumption that we&#8217;re making there is that we allow ourselves the ability to mark the digital divide is fixed in our minds. Once we get enough access to everyone, we&#8217;re just done. There is no more divide. But as a way of illustration, if you think about access, not in the context of technology, like high technology, digital technology, and in the context of like writing, you probably own a writing utensil, and you probably have access to paper of some sort, which is great. But just because you have like a pencil and a piece of paper doesn&#8217;t mean that I can send you home right now &#8211; I guess most of you are listening at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t mean that I can send you to your desk right now. And consider you prepared to write a best-selling novel, right? Because giving you physical tools no more makes you a novelist than handing me a computer when I was a teen made me digitally literate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s talk about what it takes to be digitally literate. I&#8217;ve lumped the following skills into three groups. It&#8217;s broadly defined as 21st-century skills, but the groups that I have them in is not a comprehensive list of those 21st-century skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first group that is a large component of digital literacy is critical thinking skills. So computational thinking and problem-solving. That particular one is not new, exactly. But the computational thinking part certainly is. Not all problems are solved with code, but the basis for thinking through things procedurally is increasingly important.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one in that set is communication through multiple media, consuming communications or content through Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, or any other format, but also creating the things that communicate—writing blogs, creating videos, both calls and standalone, and forums, things like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third set in that group of critical thinking skills is around collaboration, which some people will say is more about communication. But I find that collaboration both online and in-person is a skill set all to its own. Communication only gets you so far when you&#8217;re learning to cook to collaborate with people that you don&#8217;t normally work with. And so, I have lumped that into critical thinking skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second big bucket for digital literacy is actually literally digital literacy. So I have three, three things in here as well. Evaluating information is obviously incredibly important in the environment that we&#8217;re in right now, for just information’s sake. But then things like understanding the differences between copyright versus copyleft licenses, understanding the difference between an .org ending URL and a .com ending URL, and evaluating the general veracity of sources that you&#8217;re finding on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of that group is media use and creation, understanding the difference between folks who consume and folks who create the content we have, how to find information online, and the most sensible places to keep information online. And the third area of digital literacy that I find to be vitally important is the ethics of licenses both around use and access. So again, things like copyright vs. Copy, copyleft. And specifically for WordPress, that means understanding things like the Creative Commons licenses, GPL, MIT, but then also copyright is its own complicated question unto itself. But the other things that show up for us for WordPress that show up for us with technology are also things like open access versus proprietary information and sources. And things like plagiarism versus sampling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And our third big bucket, which has become increasingly complex, but the third big bucket for digital literacy to my mind is actually considered something that I call life skills. So things like self-direction, knowing what you want to do next, and how to get it done. Time management is also in there, knowing how much time something will take and being able to make sure that you are getting things done over time, as opposed to trying to accomplish everything at the last second.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big part of these life skills is cross-cultural and social communication. The internet is tricky, right? Because it&#8217;s simultaneously incredibly insular and increasingly global. Like you can if you wanted only ever read things that already confirm your existing biases. But the very nature of the internet, the very nature of the web, means that the world is much smaller. We have more ready access faster to everyone everywhere in the world than we used to have. This means, of course, that cultural awareness is an absolute must now more than ever. This is for what it&#8217;s worth the time of year when I give this talk. And that&#8217;s because of this last part of the life skills section, which is digital citizenship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital citizenship generally is the second week of October 2 or the third week of October. And it&#8217;s one of my favorite weeks because it is something that comes up all the time in our ecosystem. It comes up all the time and open source in general, but certainly for WordPress. So those are our three big buckets of digital literacy, a subset of 21st-century skills as a whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>09:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a lot of stuff, I know. And it&#8217;s also really hard to figure out how you can learn any of those skills, and from my experience, I really believe that WordPress as an open source project can help people learn those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>09:43</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once upon a time, ages and ages ago, my mother told me that in order for me to become a better writer, I would have to read and in order to become a better communicator, it would probably help if I spent a little bit more time writing, and I have always felt that the same must be true for all the things that we learn, you find a positive example and study it to become better. Or, depending on what you&#8217;re learning and how you&#8217;re trying to learn it, you find a passive example of something that you want to be able to do better from an active standpoint and participate in that so that your active production of the other part is better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few parts of the WordPress project and WordPress itself that can help with this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are first a few really specific teams; if you&#8217;re contributing to a team like Themes, or Plugins, or Core, the three areas of those digital literacy skills that you have an opportunity to learn there. For critical thinking, you&#8217;re going to run into problem-solving and computational thinking. You’re also going to run into distributed collaboration, which was really important as just a concept when I first wrote this talk. And now it is currently really important as a reality because we have a bunch of companies that are going to either remote work or partially distributed or fully distributed. And that&#8217;s the way that WordPress has worked for a pretty long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>11:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve always felt like it was important because it was important to WordPress, but it&#8217;s also becoming increasingly an important part of just how to exist in the world at the moment. For those three teams, the things that you can really tap into and practice for the life skill section are digital literacy, nope, digital citizenship, self-direction, and time management obviously comes up in any open source project because you are volunteering your time and it is up to you to kind of decide how much you can commit or not various other parts of time management and directing one&#8217;s own project. Now, but you also get the opportunity to test and practice your cross-cultural communication, social communication and learning what it means to collaborate across cultures in that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:15</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the digital literacy side, you also get a little bit of that information evaluation and synthesis for what it&#8217;s worth. And then obviously get to learn more about the ethics of various types of licenses and how use and access relate to those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a team or two; these are not really teams or twos. These are things that you can do that are either solo activities or group activities. One is working or checking out the support forums, and the other is blogging. We’ll start with support forums.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re doing this as a group activity, there are a couple of extra things that that you can practice here. But suppose you&#8217;re doing it as a solo, just way to give back to the project sort of thing or way to learn some of these skills sort of thing. In that case, you can get almost all of these digital literacy skills woven into working in the support forums, depending on what&#8217;s happening in the moment and the questions people have brought up. But for critical thinking, obviously, you get some problem solving in there, not as much the computational thinking as the procedural thinking part. But you certainly also get to tap into communication with multiple types of media, collaboration in person and online, depending on whether you&#8217;re doing this as a solo effort or a group effort. And then, of course, research, which I didn&#8217;t really bring up in any of those groupings for digital literacy, is certainly a very important part of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>13:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the digital literacy grouping of skills related to digital literacy, you get to work on evaluating information and, depending on how complicated an answer might be. You can also get that opportunity to practice synthesizing complex information and research, a digital literacy skill. And then, once people have responded to a topic you&#8217;ve answered, you also get to tap into that life skill section. You get to be you get the opportunity to practice digital citizenship related to synchronous or asynchronous conversation. You also get to see more about how cross-cultural communication and collaboration works and social communication across those various boundaries that naturally show up when we&#8217;re working across cultures that way. And as I mentioned previously, information synthesis, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>14:53</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one that I have mentioned can be like a solo effort or a group effort, depending on what you do. Blogging, for most people who use WordPress, is probably the most common application of how WordPress can help you do stuff. So I often see it as the most relevant and the most immediately accessible to anyone. But you know, you got to meet people where they are. So, I would strongly believe that this is our best way to help people learn these things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So blogging for the critical thinking sorts of things, you have an opportunity to practice communication across mediums. You will probably get an opportunity to practice your research skills, chances are, you&#8217;re going to get the opportunity to practice some problem solving, and honestly, like if you&#8217;re hosting your site, problem-solving is going to come up when using WordPress as soon as you add in plugins and themes, because you sometimes kind of have to figure out what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not, and what&#8217;s playing nicely with other things and what&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s possible that with blogging, you&#8217;re also going to have an opportunity to get to practice some distributed collaboration. But that&#8217;s probably going to depend on what you&#8217;re doing with your site as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>16:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Licenses and how they apply to the thing that you&#8217;re using feel a bit different when you are the one who&#8217;s creating. And so learning about how those things work and don&#8217;t work and how they can best suit what you&#8217;re trying to do. Blogging is absolutely an excellent opportunity to dig into that a bit and learn a bit more about that. As far as your life skills go,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>16:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that&#8217;s where you, again, get to practice some digital citizenship by figuring out who your audiences are and also when you have to communicate with them via the comments or any other way that you have built up a feedback mechanism there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>17:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-direction obviously will come into this, maybe time management if you are blogging on, I was gonna say on a paid basis, but that&#8217;s not really I don&#8217;t know, on a project basis, like some of us are students and have to write things based on deadlines. And so, you know, self-direction, potentially time management, always cross-cultural communication, social communication, research, all of these things show up in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>17:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you know, I really believe in this concept of how blogging and bringing people into maintaining a website can teach you all of these skills. Because when I was younger, I was a bad communicator. And now, I am across the board known for my effective communication and my ability to work across cultures. And so the defining moment, which was like a four-year moment, and so not necessarily a moment, but the thing that really made all the difference was when my mom challenged me to write every single day. She had noted that I was not necessarily great at getting from one point to the next. I wasn&#8217;t necessarily great at building my arguments when I had to explain something to people. And she suggested that writing every day would help me tap into this big thing about communication and working with other people collaboration, all of that. And as an adult on the other side of it. Like, I thought she was super wrong when I was younger, because don&#8217;t we all think our parents are wrong when we&#8217;re younger. But as an adult on the other side of it, not only was that an opportunity for me to literally learn how to communicate better. But it also, when I look at it, gave me access to opportunities to practice all sorts of 21st-century skills and digital literacy skills in an environment that was relatively safe. And so, I am a big proponent of this particular one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>19:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another team that helps us tap into and practice a lot of our digital literacy skills is the Documentation team. I recommend that you let this be a supervised activity if you&#8217;re doing this with students because, you know, it&#8217;s a wiki. You can put weird things in there on accident or just inaccurate things. So for critical thinking, the primary skill that you&#8217;re going to be able to practice if you&#8217;re working on documentation is collaboration. You would think that it was also like information synthesis and information evaluation. But for a lot of the work that we&#8217;re doing, the documentation exists. And what we&#8217;re looking at is trying to figure out where it no longer matches what is currently in the CMS, or currently in the project or currently in the team, whatever it is that you&#8217;re working on at that moment. And so, it&#8217;s a strong collaborative effort in the WordPress project. You have to have done the general work to figure out what needs to be changed in the documentation. But a lot of times, you need to figure out who has access to make the changes, what has prevented us from making changes in the past, and things like that. And so I say, collaboration is the only one to learn and critical thinking, but it&#8217;s actually a really big one and can take a fair amount of effort in this particular context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>20:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the digital literacy aspect, of course, there is evaluating information. But this particular type of information evaluation is a little different for documentation. And this actually is true for the Documentation team, for the Training team, and also for the new Learn team. This question is true for all of them. There is a huge difference between presentation versus application of information. The way you present information for people who already know it and just need confirmation of something or are using it for reference material is really different from when people are looking at a piece of documentation that should be telling them how to accomplish something. And they try to apply it either to their own processes at the moment or apply it to teaching other people. And so evaluating information to make sure that what is presented can be applied, and all of the ways that that very complicated journey with managing information can kind of work or not, depending on how things are going in your section of the open source project at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>21:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third group of skills that you can really dig into in those teams, again, is digital citizenship, basically, everything is digital citizenship in WordPress because we&#8217;re just people online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>22:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this final grouping that we have this final team and group of skills. So the Community team is a substantial and far-ranging team; they have many things that fall into their area of expertise. And so this has traditionally kind of functioned as a linchpin around education and ensuring that that was all relevant for users and attendees of events. The Community team will remain pivotal to so many things that we do now. But now that we have really awakened the Learn team and re-enlivened that Training team, this will shift a little over time. But yes, so that grain of salt that depending on when you listen to this, if you listen to it in 2050, maybe it&#8217;s not accurate anymore. Hopefully, most of what I say is not accurate in 2050. But you know, still.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>23:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Anyway! Critical thinking that&#8217;s where we were. So the critical thinking group of skills inside the Community team, you are going to have an opportunity to practice problem-solving. And frequently also procedural thinking, depending on what you&#8217;re working on in that team. Multimedia communication is absolutely true. And that&#8217;s true, whether you contribute to the team itself and make sure that the team is functioning and doing their basic tasks. Or if you are organizing an entire event, whether it&#8217;s online or offline or however that is being accomplished.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>24:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multimedia communication for this particular team is constant for all of their work and something that everyone who works on there gets to practice all the time. For digital literacy, this comes up a lot if what you&#8217;re doing is working through any sort of like programming plans, making sure that what we have in place for events is really excellent. It&#8217;s a really excellent opportunity for practicing the evaluation of information, learning more about media use and creation, and then naturally, everything to do with licenses copyright copyleft, not only for everything that we produce but then also for everyone in the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>24:55</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This team helps so many plugins, authors and theme developers, and other groups who participate in the ecosystem understand the nuances of the GPL and why it matters so much to WordPress. And then in the life skill section, there&#8217;s the obvious life skill section, life skills that have come up for all of them—so digital citizenship, cross-cultural and social communication. But also you have the opportunity to tap into that self-direction and time management practice, which probably should also be considered in all of these teams. But, you know, things change as we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>25:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are the most likely digital literacy skills that you would end up practicing in the Community team, depending on how you are participating in the Community team at that moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>25:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I said that we would talk a little bit about where this is all headed and what to do next. And like I just said, when I got lost in my own reverie, they&#8217;re like, hopefully, everything that I&#8217;ve shared here is out of date by 2050. Like, if we can come back to this particular podcast, or this presentation, or anything I&#8217;ve ever said, about digital literacy over my time with WordPress. And if we could come back to that in 2050, or, you know, I was going to say, 20 years from now, 2041 feels really close. But, you know, come back to it in the future, and say, that was all really excellent information to know at the moment. And we did do those things. And now, WordPress has proven that open source contribution and collaboration can teach all of the necessary 21st-century skills that anyone would need to survive in the world. And we did do it, that would be really cool. But I don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re headed. Not because I don&#8217;t think people believe in what I&#8217;m saying or care about what I&#8217;m saying. But because it&#8217;s very easy to kind of let these things go at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>27:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you at some point, were proficient in all of what is considered 21st-century skills, sometimes our skills don&#8217;t get used very much. And so we lose track of them. And we don&#8217;t know, or we don&#8217;t know how to teach them to other people and various ways to do that. So I hope that when we revisit this in the time capsule of the internet 20 years from now, we can say that was a great explanation. And we learned so much. And we made so many changes in such progress that now we need a new version of this. That&#8217;s really all we can do, always striving to leave the world in a better position than when we found it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>28:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, that brings us to our small list of big things. I don&#8217;t have a ton to share with you today. But what I do have to share with you is a really big deal. So we are about a week away from the Go/No-Go point of WordPress 5.9. That is the final release of the year. And as soon as we know what is a go or a no go from that meeting on October 12th,&nbsp; everyone is going just to hit the ground running. And so, if you are interested in contributing to that release, either by being a participant in the release squad or leading some part of the release squad. Absolutely. Drop by and let me know because I am interested to know who wants to learn more about doing that. And this is actually something that has gone by. I mentioned at the top that I spoke at WordCamp US.&nbsp; That is still true; I did do it. And so did a bunch of other really excellent presenters. If you missed WordCamp US on Friday, for whatever reason, because you know, life is complicated. Pretty soon, we will have the videos. We&#8217;ll have all the videos up with captions quickly and have those available for everyone to watch and learn more from as their schedule allows and as their attention allows. And that is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphos, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"11316\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"People of WordPress: Yordan Soares\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/09/people-of-wordpress-yordan-soares/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:14:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"heropress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"wptranslationday\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11279\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:160:\"To coincide with International Translation Day, we feature the story of a WordPress developer and translator Yordan Soares from South America. #ContributorStory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"webcommsat AbhaNonStopNewsUK\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14392:\"\n<p>In this series, we share some of the inspiring stories of how WordPress and its global network of contributors can change people&#8217;s lives for the better.

He had not expected to find a whole global movement behind the web development software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yordan, who is from Venezuela, South America, said: “The first time I used WordPress, I had no idea what was going on behind the software or beyond it. I knew there was someone making it all work, but I couldn’t even remotely imagine all the people who were making WordPress not just a tool for developing websites, but a whole movement that comes together to share, build, and help make the world better.”<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Turning your hobby into your job</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, Yordan earned his income from computer technical support and installing networks for small and medium-sized businesses. Back in 2005, web development and code-writing was just a hobby. When he discovered the concept of CSS and how it could make everything dynamic. This opened up a whole new career pathway for him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2010, an introduction to WordPress through a friend opened up a future he had not imagined. He stopped using any other content management system (CMS) and wanted to explore how much he could do with the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three years later in 2013, he was able to take his WordPress journey further by starting a small advertising agency with some of his friends. During this time, they crafted commercials for local radio and TV stations. Through WordPress, they found it easy to build more than 15 websites for businesses in a market that previously had not valued the importance of having an online presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “We were working for almost four years until at the end of 2017 the economic crisis in Venezuela became too acute, and we decided to close the agency when we stopped making profits. Taking stock of that period, I think we changed the way merchants saw the Internet business in the city.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Working full time as a freelancer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One year on in 2018, Yordan began to freelance full-time as a web developer. His first clients were primarily agencies and friends who had emigrated to other countries. Later, he expanded into freelance marketplaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, getting started as a freelancer was quite a challenging task in Venezuela. The first hindrance was getting a fair level of recompense. Additionally, the deteriorating conditions in the country with constant blackouts and internet connection failures complicated matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, Yordan was living in Guarenas, where the situation was relatively better. He managed to get a reasonably uninterrupted electricity supply with adequate internet speed, which was just good enough to complete his projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Meeting the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“Surely if I hadn’t met the community, I would have continued to work on my own, like a lone wolf, doing the ordinary work of solving problems for occasional customers and paying my bills,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Living in Guarenas, Yordan began to experience stability in his career and made new friends and contacts. He began looking for co-working spaces or technology communities nearby, and that’s when he met the WordPress community in Caracas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He quickly signed up for the first face-to-face event. As soon as the event concluded, he went to talk to the co-organizer and offered his help. He was inspired to help with designing promotional pieces, managing social networks, and organizing events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through such events, he met and connected with several people living in nearby cities.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:32% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"120\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/WP_Guarenas-Guatire-120x300-1-120x300.png?resize=120%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WordPress Guarenas-Guatire Meetup logo \" class=\"wp-image-11300 size-medium\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/WP_Guarenas-Guatire-120x300-1.png?resize=120%2C300&amp;ssl=1 120w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/WP_Guarenas-Guatire-120x300-1.png?w=240&amp;ssl=1 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\"> A few months later, with other WordPress users in the area, the idea emerged to start a new Guarenas-Guatire meetup group. The idea became a reality by December 2019, when they applied to the WordPress community team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the final approvals came in, the team started scheduling the activities. The <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/wordpress-meetup-guarenas-guatire/\">WordPress Guarenas-Guatire Meetup</a> was officially recognized!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the first quarter of 2020, just before the pandemic, Yordan and colleagues organized five face-to-face events. With the worldwide lockdown, in-person community engagements came to a halt. However, the Guarenas-Guatire community was eager to continue meeting.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep the community active and motivated, and with the support of sponsors, they started organizing online events under a format called “WordPress a la medianoche” (WordPress at midnight).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The format of these events was inspired by Alexis Arnal, who suggested meeting at midnight to make the most of the internet speed that would usually improve somewhat after that time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of writing, Yordan and the team have organized 16 WordPress a la medianoche events with an attendance of up to 50 people per online gathering. An impressive audience which enabled a comparatively small meetup to keep communications flowing at a difficult and unprecedented time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One positive of such events, is an opportunity to invite people from other countries and run sessions in partnership with others. An example was a special translation event with Javier Esteban, a member of the translation team from Spain. The meetup also invited contributors from Mexico, Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia who were happy to participate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Strengthened by the community</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"241\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?resize=632%2C241&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot from the WordPress Translation Day 2020 events streamed on YouTube featuring Yordan\" class=\"wp-image-11307\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?resize=1024%2C390&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?resize=300%2C114&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?resize=768%2C292&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?resize=1536%2C585&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?w=1889&amp;ssl=1 1889w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Yordan (pictured bottom left) speaking at the WordPress Translation Day 2020 events</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yordan believes that he would have continued to work on his own had he not met the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;Fortunately, this was not the case and I have been able to live a lot of transforming experiences that have shown me the meaning of the words &#8216;community&#8217; and &#8216;volunteerism&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yordan felt empowered by the community and it led him to volunteer for many other roles and activities, including Locale Manager for <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/locale/es-ve/\">Spanish Venezuela</a>, a moderator for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/tv/\">WordPress.tv</a>, and as a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/support/\">support</a> contributor in the forums helping people with technical issues. He has also developed free plugins for the official WordPress directory and <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/speakers/yordan-soares/\">spoken at community events</a> including <a href=\"https://spain.wordcamp.org/2020/session/actualizaciones-automaticas-para-tus-plugins-y-temas-personalizados/\">WordCamp Spain 2020</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All this has a boomerang effect, Yordan explains. These experiences helped him grow personally and professionally, as it’s always rewarding to know that you’ve helped improve the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also likes being able to directly help people when they need it and feels it is a two-way learning process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;At first, when I told my family and friends about the community and the work I was doing, they would ask me &#8216;what do you get in return?&#8217; Perhaps they expected me to tell them a specific amount of money, but the answer is more complex,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It’s rewarding to know that you’ve helped improve the WordPress ecosystem, the tool you use to work and put food on the table.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his journey, Yordan has met many wonderful people with common interests and values, and the best part is that many of these people are now his friends, business partners, or customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, he has learned new skills and gained experience, which have given him a significant confidence boost in facing difficult situations that may come in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/special-acknowledgement-yordansoares.png?resize=632%2C332&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Polyglots special appreciation poster featuring Yordan Soares. \" class=\"wp-image-11320\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/special-acknowledgement-yordansoares.png?resize=1024%2C538&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/special-acknowledgement-yordansoares.png?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/special-acknowledgement-yordansoares.png?resize=768%2C403&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/special-acknowledgement-yordansoares.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/09/join-us-for-wordpress-translation-day-global-events-in-september-2021/\">WordPress Translation Day 2021</a> celebrations, Yordan was nominated for his contribution to the work of the Polyglots Team translating WordPress.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Joseph Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I&#8217;m going to take you through a quick look at the final WordPress release of 2021. It will be WordPress 5.9. And there will be a ton of things in it, including a fresh new default theme. And there are a few things that you need to know about it right now. The target release date is December 14, 2021, which means some of our milestones happen around Thanksgiving in the US. And a few significant commercial dates globally, days, like Giving Tuesday and Black Friday, etc. I&#8217;ll include a link to the post with all the target dates in the show notes so that you can plan with those in mind. And also in the show notes. I&#8217;ll include a link to Matías Ventura&#8217;s post that includes the target features for the release. When you look at that post, you&#8217;ll notice that you can sort of group things into two big buckets. The two buckets that I grouped them into are themes plus tools, and also better tools.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So bucket number one themes and all their tools. Three things were important for me as I was reading through them. Number one is that there is a default theme. As of the time of this recording, I&#8217;ve seen the early concepts for the theme, and I love them. Hopefully, by the time this podcast is published, the post that showcases the look and feel will also be up on make.wordpress.org/design. If it is, I&#8217;ll include a link in the show notes to make it easy for everyone to reference.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is block themes in general. So WordPress 5.8 brought to core WordPress a lot of the infrastructure needed to create block themes. And in this release in WordPress 5.9, much of that infrastructure will be made available for folks who don&#8217;t always feel comfortable working in the code. That&#8217;s mostly UX and UI changes. So user experience and user interface changes are based on user feedback that we&#8217;ve gathered over the last six to eight months. But it also will include the long-awaited navigation block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third thing that shows up for me in this first bucket, in the themes and all their tools bucket, is the UX and interface for theme.json. The user interface that we&#8217;re making available for theme.json is a major step forward in this project has been referred to as global styles for a few years. And it kind of is what it sounds like on the box, a way for users to tap into that powerful management tool that we have built through theme.JSON.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bucket number two, which I am calling publicly &#8220;tools for days.&#8221; But also, I refer to it as design tools, block tools, and pattern tools. I had this whole vision of a Wizard of Oz, “lions and tigers and bears. Oh my!” moment, but I couldn’t make it work. So “design tools and block tools and pattern tools Hoorah!” That&#8217;s as close as we&#8217;re getting. So that&#8217;s my first big number two bucket for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For most of these tools, the best way to describe it is quality of life improvements, lots of streamlining of what&#8217;s there, lots of building what&#8217;s not. But there&#8217;s one that&#8217;s substantial and worth digging into a bit more. And that&#8217;s the gallery block refactor. The dev note for this already exists. Like before we had the planning round-up post, the dev note was created. And so I will put a link to that in the show notes. But the headline is that this refactor will make the creation and maintenance of image blocks and the gallery block work the same way. If you are a theme or plugin developer, head on over to the dev notes that I have linked below and take some time to get familiar with it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final thing, which has a bunch of small things in it, but will make a huge impact for all of our users overall, is that we&#8217;re working on more intuitive and responsive tools on blocks. That has come up frequently in our user testing again over the last six to eight months. And we are going to chip away at that long list of needs that we have in those particular toolsets. And that&#8217;s it. So that&#8217;s a really big broad look at what we&#8217;re trying to get into the final release of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&nbsp; know that when I say like this is our hoped for stuff. This is our best guess at the moment. Sometimes it can feel like we should know that already &#8212; I should know already what&#8217;s going into the release. And on the one hand, yes, I believe in this list of things that we&#8217;re going to put into the release, I think they&#8217;re going to be good. But I always refer to it as like the hoped-for things, the things that are on the roadmap, our best targets, because I know that I don&#8217;t ever want to ship something that is going to be a worse experience for users. And so I always like to save the space to be able to remove a feature or remove an enhancement, a little bit closer to the time of the release, just to make sure that what we are offering is the best that we can offer. However, as it says right there in the 19 learnings of open source, “if there&#8217;s a bug, there&#8217;s a job,” right? There&#8217;s a lot of tolerance in open source software for shipping, slightly imperfect work. And that&#8217;s good. When we ship software that&#8217;s a little bit imperfect, it makes it clear how everyone can participate, how everyone could participate, if they could find this WordPress community that supports the CMS.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never participated in a release and are interested in learning how it goes, you can always follow along on make.wordpress.org/core. And of course, we do a lot of our meetings in the making WordPress, community Slack, which you can find at chat.wordpress.org if you are not already in that particular instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. I have three things on my list for you. The first one is WP Translation day slash month. For folks who&#8217;ve been following along for a bit, you probably noticed that Translation Day has been going on all month long all of September so that we can have small individual local events and bring people into the process of translating WordPress and making WordPress more usable for more people, especially when they don&#8217;t necessarily speak English as their first language. It&#8217;s a wonderful event. There&#8217;s been Translation Day at the end of September for years. And this Translation Month is working its way up to that Translation Day; I will leave a link to the event page in the notes below. And I really encourage you to drop by.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WordCamp US is coming up on October 1. It is going to be a virtual event, as so many of our events are right now. Tickets are open. The schedule just got published last week. And so we have a good concept of who is talking about what while we&#8217;re there. I suggest you wander over to the schedule. Take a look at anything that might be inspirational to you or anyone who looks like they&#8217;re answering questions that you&#8217;ve had as you have been trying to build your WordPress business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing on my smallest of big things. Some of you may already be aware that <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/andreamiddleton/\">Andrea Middleton</a> has left the WordPress project. She has been an absolute fixture in the WordPress open source project for the last ten years. And while we will all miss her terribly, her work has been so influential and so foundational that we actually won&#8217;t really feel much like she&#8217;s gone. We will see the evidence of her work in everything she does and everything she has done while we build a better and more inclusive WordPress after her.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:47</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a final love letter to the community, she published a series of things that she learned about contributing to open source and especially how to contribute to WordPress as an open source project. I&#8217;m going to link those in the show notes as well. For anyone who has worked with Andrea for a long time, when you read it, it will just remind you of her voice and will be like a nice warm, comforting hug as she heads on to her next endeavors. And for folks who have never worked with her before. It&#8217;s still really excellent information that I think translates into all areas of our work, especially right now as people are moving to distributed work and remote work a bit more. Now I encourage everyone to at least give one or two of them a read.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>09:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"11248\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"Join us for WordPress Translation Day Global Events in September 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/09/join-us-for-wordpress-translation-day-global-events-in-september-2021/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 21:51:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"polyglots\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"translation\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"wptranslationday\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11215\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:126:\"WordPress contributors around the world are celebrating the sixth Global WordPress Translation Day throughout September 2021! \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"webcommsat AbhaNonStopNewsUK\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8447:\"\n<p>WordPress contributors around the world are <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">celebrating the sixth Global WordPress Translation Day</a> throughout the entire month of September!

Normally I talk to you about WordPress and stuff, but I figured that we all need a little levity in our lives right now. So today&#8217;s episode is actually just a series of bloopers and mistakes that I&#8217;ve made while recording. When I was preparing for this podcast, no one mentioned the deep weirdness of standing alone in your closet talking to yourself, nor did they realize just how lost I can get in the surpassingly, lovely lyricism of a lilting line, and then just have no idea what I&#8217;m supposed to be reading in the script that I wrote for myself. So, my dear friends, I hope these bring you a little laugh. And if we&#8217;ve got any luck at all, you may also hear me singing to myself, my computer, or about how terrible my talking just was. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to a bonus briefing. I know I wasn&#8217;t going to sit boop, boop.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:21</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I messed up the thing where I&#8217;m talking about how I mess up, of course. I&#8217;m going to do it one more time, and you can choose whatever is a reasonable thing there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we had such a lengthy WP Briefing, WordPress, I’m going to just start that over again. Sorry, everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My friends. Oh, no. I don&#8217;t know how I end my own show. How do I end my own show? There we go. Sorry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was a weird way to say that. I&#8217;m going to start over again from the transition. And then we&#8217;re just going to go straight through to the end. Maybe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The names that&#8230; I sound weird. I sound like I don&#8217;t know what my words are. And I said I wrote the words. I said I was all going to go in one go, and I&#8217;m a liar today. Okay, here we go. For realsies!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:16</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Final first last take. Here we go. Sorry, I made myself laugh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg. And, and I, I&#8217;m also in that group. I don&#8217;t know why I said that like it was a surprise. I have me too. I&#8217;m also in there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ugh, I ran out of air. For reasons, it was a short sentence. I don&#8217;t know why I ran out of air.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:43</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming out on April 14. That&#8217;s not true. It&#8217;s April 13. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:50</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the form below to share the. Pfft &#8211; what are the things!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is WP Briefing episode seven, no title because I don&#8217;t know what to call it because I gave it a title already. I gave it two titles, and then couldn&#8217;t remember why I gave it those titles. So I&#8217;ll come up with a title before we publish it. But I also have no idea what it is. I&#8217;m going to ask for help. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing project since I have too many commas, and I really believed in my comma when I said it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to Gutenberg&#8230; pfft. Open source software like WordPress. I was going to smash that sentence into half a sentence. I was going to say when you know what you&#8217;re workussing on you have a solution which is not my friends of thing. So, I am just going to say the sentence again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:47</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was sitting over here wringing my hands for some reason during that entire list. And so if you can hear me wringing my hands, which would be a whole new height of anxiety for anyone, you let me know, and I will rerecord that also.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get a concept of. Nope, this is a lie. Get a concept of where to get your tickets is the silliest thing. I&#8217;m starting over from the small list of big things. Also, because I got too excited about how big my list is. I am going to get that excited again. But I will try not to shout about it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Humming intro song&#8221; Dun dun dun dun dun.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry, I had to scroll up, and I try not to scroll up when I&#8217;m talking in case maybe my whole computer turns into a microphone. Sorry, I&#8217;m just going to keep going because this has been a fine take so far.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mercy! I have words that I can say with my mouth. They aren&#8217;t these words today. It seems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Build up to&#8230; Oh my goodness. My stomach grumbled, and this microphone, I know,&nbsp; picked it up. And so I&#8217;m going to redo bullet two so that we don&#8217;t just have a small monster under the bed in the middle of the podcast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, like DEI, I feel s—Eh &#8211; maybe I should say, DEI, somewhere in there, so it&#8217;s clear for people cause I&#8217;m talking to people and not actually a screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I joined the WordPress project, the majority of my work with accessibility was in the context of the digital divide. Now, when talking about the digital divide, there are three concepts around quote-unquote, getting things to people. And those concepts are&#8230; I guess I could say the thing, hold on one second, I can do it. I feel like I&#8217;m chopping up my words like I&#8217;m not really breathing very well. So I apologize. But here we go again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t include that one. Sorry, I&#8217;m so nervous about this episode that, like, my mouth is getting dry, and I worry that you can hear it, and it drives me nuts every time I hear podcasters with a dry mouth, and you can just like hear it clicking and always stresses me out. I&#8217;m like, someone should give that poor thing a drink of water. And I just know I&#8217;m going to feel that way about myself later. And so I&#8217;m trying to stay hydrated, but it also means that I have to stop every two paragraphs and take a drink of water. I apologize for that interlude. I am about to start again, at my next section, which is like, halfway through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I learned that you can hear me swallowing my water with this microphone because it is a spectacular microphone. And so, I apologize for that as well. All right. Here I go. I&#8217;m going to do it all in one take. Watch me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also have questions, especially about how to move everything forward. Mm-hmm. Whoops. I put especially in the wrong spot. But I also thought&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Ta da, we did it. Gosh, that&#8217;s a short one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:16</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did it. Where&#8217;s my where&#8217;s my turning offing button.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tada!

While this is a given for many widgets, the block versions of widgets can be easily wrapped and layered within container blocks to integrate them into your layout more fully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the example below, I tried placing a Search block in front of a Cover block, which creates a nice layered effect. I also inserted Custom HTML blocks within a Columns block to display different messaging depending on the time of day. (<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31242051/show-content-based-on-time-of-day-timing-changes-on-different-days-of-the-week\">jQuery script</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/custom-html-1.mov\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Use Traditional Widget Layouts (Or Not) With Lots of Flexibility Over Title and Structure</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Classic widgets have always had a lockup that includes a widget title. One cool thing about having blocks in widget areas is that you have complete flexibility over how titles appear. For example, you might choose to have a title over every widget, you might only want one title at the top of each widget area, or your design might not need titles at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: Some themes, like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyone/\">Twenty Twenty-One</a>, are designed to flow content horizontally within widget areas. If you’re having trouble with a theme splitting your layout into columns, you could try keeping the lockup together by containing it within a Group block.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/grouped.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"381\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/grouped.jpg?resize=632%2C381&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Side-by-side comparison of List View of a Sidebar widget area with and without grouped/nested lockups.\" class=\"wp-image-11122\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/grouped.jpg?w=1760&amp;ssl=1 1760w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/grouped.jpg?resize=300%2C181&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/grouped.jpg?resize=1024%2C618&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/grouped.jpg?resize=768%2C463&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/grouped.jpg?resize=1536%2C927&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/grouped.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Copy &amp; Paste Existing Layouts From the WordPress Pattern Directory</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While patterns haven’t been fully integrated into the widget editors yet, one thing you <em>can</em> do is copy and paste patterns from the game-changing new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\">WordPress Pattern Directory</a> into your site’s widget areas.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[musical interlude]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 0:28</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the second of my big scary topics for this month. I&#8217;ll be talking about accessibility, which much like Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, or DEI in the last episode, is one of those areas where the work is never finished. Also, like DEI in last episode, I feel strongly about accessibility and the need for accessible experiences in the world, but I&#8217;m aware that this is an area where I&#8217;m still learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 1:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has both an accessibility statement and team, which makes a lot of sense given that the software supports so many different people, and industries, and cultures. But if you&#8217;re not quite bought into the idea that software should be accessible, or that accessible software can&#8217;t also be usable, then this is the episode for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 1:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I joined the WordPress project, the majority of my work with accessibility was in the context of the digital divide. Now, when talking about the digital divide, there are three concepts around quote-unquote, &#8220;getting things to people,&#8221; and those are access, usability, and accessibility. Sometimes these words seem interchangeable, but ultimately they have nuanced differences that address different problems. And I like to think of them this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Access is making sure that someone can obtain something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usability is making sure that the user experience is understandable or coherent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And accessibility is making sure that it&#8217;s usable by the largest number of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have always considered each as a subset of the one that came before it. So having something everyone can access is good, but easy to access and easy to use is better. Easy to use is good, but easy to use and easily accessible is better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 2:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After joining WordPress, I discovered that accessibility in the context of software building is well, substantially more complicated. There&#8217;s no such thing as perfect accessibility, or a site that is 100% accessible, and many aspects are pretty open to interpretation. It turns out that accessibility, like so many things in WordPress, is a complicated intersection of art and science.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an example, there&#8217;s a rule that says, &#8220;Ensure that links are recognizable as links.&#8221; A fast shorthand to accomplish that, that we see all over the internet, is to underline all links or put that icon next to it that says, &#8220;This opens in a new tab.&#8221; You know that icon that&#8217;s a box with an arrow? That definitely has a name, that I definitely don&#8217;t know? That icon. [laughing] But those solutions don&#8217;t necessarily fit every context that you&#8217;ll find a link in, and that&#8217;s where we see that intersection between the art of communication and the science of necessity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 3:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you came with me earlier on the idea that accessibility is a subset of usability, and it&#8217;s not a far leap to say that the choices around accessibility implementations should always include design and the overall user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that some of you are thinking, &#8220;But we have guidelines! Like, that&#8217;s why we have the guidelines, so that not everything has to be a gray area.&#8221; And on the one hand, yeah, that&#8217;s true. There are a lot of guidelines. There are guidelines for the code, and what the code produces, and the design elements. But I worry that when a solution is driven solely by rules, rather than reasons, we run the risk of throwing out the good along with the bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 4:15</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accessibility has been a consistent topic of debate in the project for as long as I can remember, and based on all of this, it&#8217;s really clear why. There are a few big picture questions that still deserve some sort of canonical answer for WordPress, and where possible I dig in and research the positions that everyone has taken in the past. But I also have questions about how to move everything forward, especially as the editing experience gets more and more standardized across the software, which reduces cognitive load, shortens the learning curve, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is the future possibility for having a series of more niche admin interface options?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would it be like to be able to account for functional limitations in a way that lets site builders select what is needed for their clients or organization, or just individual situations they know their sites would be maintained under?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What more could we do if part of the setup flow of WordPress was to select some bundle of potential add ons for neuro diversity, or colorblindness, or dyslexia, and more?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a really big question I have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 5:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have to be really transparent here and share that my foundational understanding of accessibility and usability is 10 plus years old, and I learned it in the context of people in education, not software. So a lot of my questions about the future of accessibility and WordPress is the result of old knowledge exploring new spaces, which means they are a little untested. And I&#8217;m so grateful for the contributors who point out what the current research and thinking is, in this incredibly complex field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 6:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I normally like to wrap up the briefing with a tidy takeaway, but this particular topic doesn&#8217;t really lend itself to that. So I&#8217;ll leave you with this. I really believe in WordPress&#8217; mission to democratize publishing. And I, for one, will never stop learning about what gives people more access to the software, and what makes the software more usable, and especially how we can combine usability with accessibility in a way that puts form and function on a level playing field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[musical interlude]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 6:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, that brings us to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thing one, it&#8217;s that time of year where many of our community members take a short break to relax and refresh. I&#8217;ll be taking a bit of a break during the month of August, and so the WP Briefing will return again starting in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And thing two, huge thanks to the production crew that helps me make this podcast every couple of weeks, but a special shout out to our editor Dustin Hartzler, who makes quick work of all of my rambling thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 7:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[contemporary outro music]</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"11096\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"Configuring Theme Design with theme.json\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/configuring-theme-design-with-theme-json/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 22:26:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"design\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11060\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:368:\"Starting in WordPress 5.8, a new tool — “theme.json” — is available to use in your theme.

Maybe you’re hearing about it for the first time, or maybe you’re testing and developing themes with it already. Either way, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re here because it&#8217;s an exciting time for WordPress themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This post provides a quick introduction to this new framework, and describes what’s possible by sharing a few practical tips and examples.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s theme.json?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically, theme.json is just a file that lives at the top-level of a theme’s directory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conceptually, it’s a major shift in how themes can be developed. Theme authors now have a centralized mechanism to tailor the WordPress experience for site authors and visitors. Theme.json provides theme authors fine-grained control over global styles, block styles, and the block editor settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By providing these settings and controls in a single file, theme.json provides a powerful framework that brings together many aspects of theme design and development. And as the block editor matures and adds more features, theme.json will shine as the backbone for themes and the editor to work <em>together</em> <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f4aa.png\" alt=\"💪\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Use it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s the future! But if you’re like me, you might need something more tangible to be convinced. Here are a few reasons why you might use theme.json today:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Control editor settings like color, typography, spacing, and layout, and consolidate where these settings are managed.</li><li>Guarantee that styles apply correctly to blocks and elements across your site.</li><li>Reduce the amount of boilerplate CSS a theme used to provide. Theme.json won&#8217;t replace your stylesheet completely — there will be instances where CSS is needed to give your theme that extra flare (transitions, animations, etc.). But it can greatly reduce the base CSS needed from the theme.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How do I use it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of this post demonstrates a few theme.json configurations you can try out. The examples use the tt1-blocks<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/theme-experiments/blob/master/tt1-blocks/theme.json\"> theme.json</a> — <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tt1-blocks/\">the block-based version of this year’s default theme</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re starting with an existing theme, you might try copying a theme.json from the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/theme-experiments/\">WordPress/theme-experiments repository</a> (for example, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/theme-experiments/blob/master/fse-tutorial/theme.json\">the fse-tutorial theme</a> by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/poena/\">@poena</a>) and adding it to the root of your theme’s directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Change the typography settings of your site globally</strong></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript;

Now you can add blocks both in widget areas across your site and with live preview through the Customizer. This opens up new possibilities to create content: from no-code mini layouts to the vast library of core and third-party blocks. For our developers, you can find more details in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/29/block-based-widgets-editor-in-wordpress-5-8/\">Widgets dev note</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Display Posts with New Blocks and Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Query Loop Block makes it possible to display posts based on specified parameters; like a PHP loop without the code. Easily display posts from a specific category, to do things like create a portfolio or a page full of your favorite recipes. Think of it as a more complex and powerful Latest Posts Block! Plus, pattern suggestions make it easier than ever to create a list of posts with the design you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Edit the Templates Around Posts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the familiar block editor to edit templates that hold your content—simply activate a block theme or a theme that has opted in for this feature. Switch from editing your posts to editing your pages and back again, all while using a familiar block editor. There are more than 20 new blocks available within compatible themes. Read more about this feature and how to experiment with it in the release notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:32px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Three Workflow Helpers</h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:16px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"496\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-list-view.png?resize=632%2C496&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"10988\" data-full-url=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-list-view.png\" data-link=\"https://wordpress.org/news/?attachment_id=10988\" class=\"wp-image-10988\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-list-view.png?resize=1024%2C803&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-list-view.png?resize=300%2C235&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-list-view.png?resize=768%2C602&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-list-view.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-pattern-suggestions.png?resize=632%2C343&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"10989\" data-full-url=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-pattern-suggestions.png\" data-link=\"https://wordpress.org/news/?attachment_id=10989\" class=\"wp-image-10989\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-pattern-suggestions.png?resize=1024%2C555&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-pattern-suggestions.png?resize=300%2C163&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-pattern-suggestions.png?resize=768%2C416&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-pattern-suggestions.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"517\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-duotone.png?resize=632%2C517&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"10990\" data-full-url=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-duotone.png\" data-link=\"https://wordpress.org/news/?attachment_id=10990\" class=\"wp-image-10990\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-duotone.png?resize=1024%2C837&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-duotone.png?resize=300%2C245&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-duotone.png?resize=768%2C628&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-duotone.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Overview of the Page Structure</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes you need a simple landing page, but sometimes you need something a little more robust. As blocks increase, patterns emerge, and content creation gets easier, new solutions are needed to make complex content easy to navigate. List View is the best way to jump between layers of content and nested blocks. Since the List View gives you an overview of all the blocks in your content, you can now navigate quickly to the precise block you need. Ready to focus completely on your content? Toggle it on or off to suit your workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Suggested Patterns for Blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting in this release the Pattern Transformations tool will suggest block patterns based on the block you are using. Right now, you can give it a try in the Query Block and Social Icon Block. As more patterns are added, you will be able to get inspiration for how to style your site without ever leaving the editor!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Style and Colorize Images</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Colorize your image and cover blocks with duotone filters! Duotone can add a pop of color to your designs and style your images (or videos in the cover block) to integrate well with your themes. You can think of the duotone effect as a black and white filter, but instead of the shadows being black and the highlights being white, you pick your own colors for the shadows and highlights. There’s more to learn about how it works in the documentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:32px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">For Developers to Explore</h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:16px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"378\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=632%2C378&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10992\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=1024%2C613&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=300%2C179&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=768%2C459&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=1536%2C919&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=2048%2C1225&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?w=1896&amp;ssl=1 1896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:16px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Theme.json</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Introducing the Global Styles and Global Settings APIs: control the editor settings, available customization tools, and style blocks using a theme.json file in the active theme.

rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/\">support forums</a>. They answer questions from people across the world, whether they are using WordPress for the first time, or they’ve been around since the first release all the way back in 2003. These releases are as successful as they are because of their efforts!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, thanks to all the community translators who help make WordPress available in over 200 languages for every release. 80 languages have translated 80% or more WordPress 5.8 and our community translators are hard at work ensuring more languages are on their way. If contributing to WordPress appeals to you, it’s easy to learn more.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And before we get started, I have to be honest with you all, this episode and the next one have made me feel really anxious. This one is about Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in open source, and especially in WordPress. And the next one is about accessibility in WordPress. And I feel like there&#8217;s just so much to do, and we don&#8217;t do enough, but we do what we can. And still, we will never be done with that work. And if you don&#8217;t know what I mean by Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, you can kind of think of it this way. Diversity is bringing in people with different viewpoints and lived experiences. Equity is making sure everyone has what they need to get a fair chance of success, which is different from equality. And Inclusion is making sure that the environment is built to not only tolerate diverse groups but to celebrate them as well. So remember this as you listen to what I have to say here. We are never where we want to be in either of those spaces. But that shouldn&#8217;t stop us from looking at the things we have done to get us in the right direction. All right. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I say a lot that we are a project that serves a majority collection of minority voices. WordPress is global in reach and open source in nature. And you would assume that what allows the software to be used by anyone would also enable it to be built by anyone. After all, your location doesn&#8217;t matter, and who employs you also doesn&#8217;t matter. And your relative social standing certainly shouldn&#8217;t matter. As long as you can communicate with the others contributing to the project, there should be no obstacle to your participation. The mission of the WordPress project is to democratize publishing, right? It&#8217;s to get the ability to have a website tap into passive income on your web presence. I mean, the job is to level the playing field for everyone. However, it&#8217;s my experience that bringing in new voices takes a lot of proactive work on behalf of leaders and contributors. It&#8217;s not enough to say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m having a party,&#8221; you also have to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m having a party, and I&#8217;d like you to be there.&#8221; It&#8217;s not enough to think people will make their own space at this table. You have to make sure that you have table settings for everyone. And even beyond the basics of directing people to you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on toward the next steps, you have to be honest about the fact that open source contribution requires a fair amount of privilege. By privilege, I mean the luxury of extra time or extra funding or just an understanding employer. WordPress supports 41% of the web. I think it&#8217;s 42% of the web right now. But less than 1% of people who use WordPress show up to help maintain it. And that 1% that does show up skews toward people who already have a pretty high level of representation and technology. And so, when you look at who is building it versus who is using it, it doesn&#8217;t always match. And since what we build so frequently reflects who we are, sometimes what we build doesn&#8217;t match the needs of the people who are using what we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what has WordPress done to be proactive on the question of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion? There are quite a few unseen things that have gone into this over the years and a few pretty visible things. This is a very long list. And it has a whole lot of just reference material. And so the show notes today will come in handy for people, and there will be just a laundry list of linked resources for everyone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the first thing that WordPress has done is that we have accepted the burden of proof. I&#8217;m going to share a post about this in the show notes. That means we accept that it&#8217;s not the job of underrepresented folks to figure out if they are welcome. It&#8217;s up to us to make it clear that they are. So, there are three big little things that the community has done over the years. One is that many teams open their text-based meetings with an explanation of what is done in the meeting, who comes to the meetings, where to find help if you&#8217;re lost in the meeting, and for teams that have a specific type of requests that comes into those channels that aren&#8217;t handled in those channels. They also will share where people can go to get those requests taken care of. Many teams have also updated their team handbooks to have good beginner docs, limited use of inside jokes or jargon, and good first bugs. And also, there is a code of conduct in the community declaring that everyone is welcome and clarifies what to do if you see folks being unwelcoming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:51</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second big thing that folks in the WordPress community have done is written down what was unwritten. Having things clearly documented unlocks institutional knowledge that you&#8217;d otherwise have to know someone to get. Clarity and process and the structure help anyone engage with your organization, not just the people who have extra time to figure things out. What that looks like in the WordPress project is that many teams have documented their workflows and their working spaces and just their general team norms. Many teams have also started defining what it means to be a team rep and holding open processes to choose those team reps. Many other community leaders and I have written down countless unspoken rules, guidelines, and philosophical underpinnings so that people don&#8217;t have to guess what we&#8217;re doing or why we&#8217;re doing things, or where we want to do them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:46</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the more visible thing that the WordPress project has been doing is that we found ways to invite people in, and they&#8217;re not failsafe; they’re not foolproof, but it is certainly a step in the right direction. The first one is an ongoing, diverse speaker training initiative. And I&#8217;ll include a link to that in the show notes as well. It is run by Jill Binder and a fantastic group of contributors that collaborate with her. And I really have loved watching that particular program grow and flourish and help WordPress make a difference where we absolutely can.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that was pretty visible about how we invited people in was at the end of 2020, and we had an all-women and nonbinary release squad for our biggest release of the year; WordPress 5.6. I had a group of probably 70 women and nonbinary identifying folx who joined in the process and joined in learning more about the process. Some of them have continued in the project. Others have stepped away for various reasons. But all of them are welcome to return. And I encourage everyone to return to contribution when time and resources make that possible for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing that we&#8217;ve done, which I have talked about a lot, is the revival of the testing and triage practices. That has been work that&#8217;s been ongoing for a number of years. And it happens across multiple teams. It is not always immediately clear to people why the testing work. And the triage work is identifiable for me as a way to invite people into this process. And so I&#8217;ll be briefly clear about it right now. So testing as a practice brings in the users that otherwise don&#8217;t have a lot of spare time and that extra privilege to like, figure out what&#8217;s going on with WordPress, and contribute their own fixes to problems. They can give back to this project by being co-developers with us, co-creators with our entire process of making WordPress real and usable for the largest number of people that we can because we now support 42% of the web. And then, the triage practice invites in a diverse voice of people. Because you don&#8217;t necessarily always need to know everything about a project to help with triage. And when you&#8217;re helping with triage, you get active learning through participating in the process. But you also get passive learning from the people who already know huge amounts about the project and the process and everything that goes into it. And so it&#8217;s a low key low stress way to get your feet wet and start building that knowledge that sometimes is hard to come by unless you are actively working in it. So the testing practices, the triage practices, I really to the core of my being believe that those are active and ongoing ways for us to invite people who otherwise wouldn&#8217;t have a chance to get their voices heard in an open source project. And y&#8217;all, as I said at the start, y’all, there&#8217;s nothing about this list that I just shared, which makes me feel like our work on this is done. Just like any muscle, you don&#8217;t fight to peak fitness, and then hit the big stop button on time and say, &#8220;Now, I never have to work out again.&#8221; If we did, the world would be a very different place probably. But it does then lead us to the next steps for fostering a community culture that&#8217;s as broad as the people who use this software. If you believe in leadership at any level, as I do, there are a ton of things that you can do right now. But I&#8217;ll boil them down into three big chunks of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, check your community area, or whatever community you want to apply this to, for things that need a little more proactive work. I will share a post called<em> Building A Culture of Safety</em> that will take you through a list of good first steps. And it is not as hard as it looks. When you say build a culture of safety, there are many really clear-cut minor changes that you can ask people to make and, in like, four or five different areas that can help your community be more welcoming and more open.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>11:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that you can do is know that small changes add up over time and commit to making those changes where you can. If you are elite at any level, you know that supporting people and processes is the responsibility of everyone in the group. And if you can make your own autonomous decisions and commit to making small changes that make a big difference over time, you will be part of that solution. And that is not specific to any one group that we have in our communities. You can be an ally for anyone, whether they look like you, whether they have your same experiences, or not. And sometimes, it&#8217;s as easy as just holding space for the people who haven&#8217;t had a chance to talk yet. And on the subject of holding space and the way that we communicate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third thing that I think is incredibly important is that you can take on as a foundational personal practice the concept of ethical communication. I&#8217;ll share a post about that as well in the show notes, but the core of it is that you have to know that what you say and don&#8217;t say what you do and don&#8217;t do has an impact on others and embrace that responsibility. All right, so you made it all the way through, and I am so proud of you. I&#8217;m sure you have questions about this. And I encourage you to share those. You can email them to me at wp briefing@wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>13:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This brings us to our small list of big things. I&#8217;ve got two things for you today. First and foremost, WordPress 5.8 gets released tomorrow. It&#8217;s a big release, and lots of people have been working on it. So get your update processes ready and keep an eye on wordpress.org/news for the announcement post. Second, and still pretty important, team reps have been working on their quarterly check-ins so that all other teams can get an idea of what&#8217;s happening around the WordPress office. Keep an eye out for that post on make.wordpress.org/updates. And that is your smallest of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:29</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The month of November includes the Thanksgiving holiday in my part of the world and in my familial traditions. And one of the things that November always brings up for me is the concept of gratitude. I have a gratitude practice that lasts throughout the year. But this time of year always kind of lets me look outside what makes me feel routinely grateful and explore areas that I don&#8217;t always notice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:05</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, I&#8217;m taking some time to do that in the context of the WordPress project, and it&#8217;s reminded me of one of the foundational things I talk about a lot that may be a little harder for folks to see. I am routinely grateful, of course, for the people who show up to maintain WordPress, the people who keep the back office work going, the contributors who contribute directly to the WordPress CMS and project, the folks who routinely go out and tell other people about WordPress and make sure others know how to use it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s another group that I talk about a lot that is a little harder to grasp. And that&#8217;s this conceptual group of people whose lives have been changed by WordPress. I used to run into people like this all the time when I was organizing WordCamps. And the small but meaningful successes that they share year after year made me realize that my small contribution of organizing these events was really quite valuable; valuable to them, and I assumed also valuable to just other people in the WordPress project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if you&#8217;re contributing in a way that doesn&#8217;t let you have contact with the same users consistently over time, or if contributing doesn&#8217;t quite balance out in your ledger at the moment, it can be hard to put names to faces in a way that lets you see how your contributions are making an impact. To help with that, a few years ago, the WordPress project partnered with the community Marketing team and the HeroPress team to share the People of WordPress series which you can find monthly on wordpress.org/news. For me, this series provides a glimpse into the humanity of the people who use WordPress, and for me, that&#8217;s enough. If all the series ever did was to remind us that WordPress was made for people whose needs matter, that would be enough to continue to have that series forever. But fortunately, the series does quite a bit more than that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The People of WordPress series also lifts up the stories of people who we don&#8217;t always hear from in technology. It highlights the wide array of origin stories that lead people to WordPress. It reminds us of the global nature of what we&#8217;re doing. It reconnects us to the hopefulness of our own first WordPress successes. And it draws a direct line to why we should care about refreshing the commons of this open ecosystem. I&#8217;m sure that there are more things that do as well. But those are just the things off the top of my head, we draw all of the people of WordPress stories that are inside that series directly from the HeroPress essays that have been submitted by users. And I was gonna say users like you in a kind of Reading Rainbow way. But I actually don&#8217;t know if any of you are everyday users who are also using WordPress but maybe not contributing yet. If you are then like I&#8217;m talking to you. And if you&#8217;re not, I&#8217;m probably still talking to you. Because all of these stories that go to HeroPress are very valuable and very important for us to know. Anyway, I digress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:14</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\">Topher DesRosia</a>, who founded HeroPress, is among the first people I met in the community lo these many years ago. And I think the impact that HeroPress has on the WordPress community as a whole is not always well recognized. So in the spirit of expanding the scope of my gratitude, and in the context of refreshing the commons, I would encourage you to head over to HeroPress.com and their newly launched HeroPress Network and see if there&#8217;s any little way that you can contribute to their commons, submitting your story donating to their network offering a small bit of volunteer time if you happen to have any spare time lying around. I know that the team would be delighted to hear from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:01</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That leads us now to our small list of big things. We are about a week away from the feature freeze for WordPress 5.9, the final release of the year. Feature freeze caused a little confusion last time. So I just want to clarify there won&#8217;t be a package released with this milestone. But no more enhancements or features will be worked on at that point. And bug fixing will become the primary focus. That will be on November 9, which I believe is next Tuesday. It&#8217;s definitely next week whenever the calendar turns to nine of November 2021. That&#8217;s the day that we&#8217;re going into feature freeze. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second big thing in our small list of big things is that team rep nomination season is upon us. If you are a team rep or want to learn more about being one, now is the time to kind of look at what&#8217;s going on and how to keep everything moving in that way. I&#8217;ll include a link to the announcement post of that in the notes below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, Daylight Saving Time movements are also upon us. Some parts of the world are ending Daylight Saving Time others are starting it and some have already started or stopped that already.

We are recording this on October 29 in 2021. In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg 11.8, navigation block, full-site editing and the plugin machine. I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and developer advocate for WordPress at Automattic. And I&#8217;m here with my co-host, co-worker fellow European and friend Grzegorz Ziolkowski, JavaScript developer at Automattic and WordPress core contributor. Howdy howdy Grzegorz, how are you doing today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Howdy, howdy Birgit? I&#8217;m great today. Oh, that&#8217;s a good way to begin that. Today I met with my co-workers from Poland; we met in a co-working space, that was really nice to meet them again about, I guess two years. That&#8217;s a lot of time and a lot has changed. So we had spent a lot of time catching up, and meet some new co-workers. So very exciting. And yeah, I&#8217;m ready to talk about what&#8217;s happening in the Gutenberg world. And how are you today Birgit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, I&#8217;m excited. My new pixel six pro phone will be delivered this weekend, and I&#8217;m looking forward to sunset-setting my old phone that&#8217;s from 2018. And it seems like it&#8217;s too long, although it&#8217;s only four years, right? Yeah. So I will plan to test the new camera features over the weekend. And it&#8217;s a good excuse to get out on a photo tour downtown or around town. Yeah. So&#8230; yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I&#8217;m looking forward to see some footage from your walks in Florida.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes. So maybe I need to start a little photo blog and not put them all on Instagram. Yeah-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: That&#8217;s a good way to use Gutenberg and create a gallery using the gallery blog. That&#8217;s going to be in using inner blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. Yeah, but it&#8217;s still not as easy. And I like WordPress to be as easy as Instagram, but it&#8217;s not yet with the photos. So maybe I should switch teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, maybe to the mobile team that is working on the Gutenberg app and they have some features that will help with that in the future. I hope so.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I will try that out, definitely, yeah. So we have a few announcements that theme.json and block.json are now available through the schemastore.org. And you can add the location, the URL of the schema on the top of your JSON file, and then your code editor supports this with your suggestions for the keys and values. You don&#8217;t have to look up exact syntax, and can avoid missing commas and end quotes. Grzegorz, you and Marcus are working on the canonical version for the Gutenberg ripple to integrate. So how does that work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Birgit, we are still discussing how to approach that, because at the moment we are using an external project, that has a URL that could change one day for whatever reason. And WordPress prefers to have control over everything. Also, if we have it stored locally, then we will be able to integrate that in the process. So when there is a change in a core block, we can validate that and ensure that it&#8217;s always up to date. And you already count a few issues with existing blocks, which is a good testament that the tooling is really solid. And yeah, so probably one of the ways we could approach that, and Marcus discovered that Microsoft is using this approach, that we could just create a redirect to a URL, that would be like something in the wp.org domain, I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s something that we will find out. But I&#8217;m really excited about that, because this will help a lot, especially with the theme.JSON, which is a huge file to maintain. And it also shows hints, so if you provide&#8230; There are descriptions, so it explains what the given properties about, what values are available there. So also people will be able to contribute to that, and improve the hints, so this is really exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So I&#8217;m glad we talked about this here quite there, early in the process. So whoever, if you want to use it more and you want to contribute, yeah. Grzegorz and Marcus are the person to-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. So just to be clear, so the credit should go to Alex Lender from Automattic, he originally submitted the first version of schema for theme.json file. And then the follow up was for the blog.json. So great work on that, and the idea was excellent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And Alex Lender, there&#8217;s also the developer who did the whole duotone feature, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes, that&#8217;s him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay. So, but WordPress 5.9 is coming up fast, FeatureFreeze is November 9th, that&#8217;s less than two weeks. And Gutenberg 11.9, which is the same date, November 9th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: What a coincidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Will be the last version with features to get into core. The release candidate has been rescheduled for the plugin, has been rescheduled for November 5th instead of November 3rd. But the final release will be after FeatureFreeze on November 10th, but the release candidate is the version that will get into core, for the first FeatureFreeze kind of. Then between November first and ninth, the team will be working on merging all the packages and code with core for the 5.9 release. Are you going to do it before that, like a dry run too? Or you&#8217;re just going to use this, the whole thing in one scoop into one core?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Oh, so I don&#8217;t know about this one. I didn&#8217;t follow that so closely, because I&#8217;m working on another project. I&#8217;m working on new version of the comments, query loop block, which is going to be responsible for displaying comments and comments form. But from my experience, it might be a few comments on the WordPress core site, because it&#8217;s quite complex, it&#8217;s&#8230; So the packages that update only JavaScript, but there is a lot of features that require PHP changes, which is more complex to tackle. I don&#8217;t know, I guess it will take a few days, hopefully they have enough boundaries to finish that on time. But also FeatureFreeze, it&#8217;s mostly about making a cut that this is what we provide for the release. And I wouldn&#8217;t be so worried if the merging is delayed a little bit, because what matters here, is the date for Beta one, which is November 16, right? So there will be a couple of days to make sure that everything is solid enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So as you said, Beta on November 16th, and then the final release of WordPress 5.9 will be on December 14th, 2021. All right, so we got that out of the way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to start now building blocks and need kind of a rundown, what all needs to be there. Of course there is a developer handbook, but Carlo Daniele from Kinsta has actually published a great tutorial, building custom Gutenberg blocks for definitive block development tutorial, and we will share the link and the show notes. So he walks us through all the prerequisites, and then all the tooling, and then also get into one block, an example block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s a more complex block than the one that is provided in the official block development tutorial in the block editor handbook. And it&#8217;s also really is collected in one article that you can just process, and it provides a different option. So it&#8217;s not that step by step, but you have options in every step that you can take. For instance, you can use WPN for building your WordPress local environment, but you could also use the other option that as provided, I don&#8217;t remember what exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, Kinsta has their own local development tool, and then there is local as well. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Recently the WordPress repository of the Gutenberg examples has been updated. Ryan Welcher went through all the examples and updated them to the newest APIs, and make them work. I think you also have found one, a few that are a little bit more complicated than the &#8216;hello world&#8217; examples. So it&#8217;s definitely now another repository to go to, to have examples that work, and you can learn from in your journey to developing the blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. So, he did that, most of the work he did live streaming on Twitch, which is also recorded on his YouTube account. And it&#8217;s really a great way to see the steps he does to update everything. And the nice thing about that is also that the examples use up to the syntax, the latest APIs, and the most correct recommendations from the Gutenberg core team. So he did exciting work, very great work there, but also he is now looking and integrating some tooling that helps developers like code formatting, code linking. So, there are now integrations with IDEs, so everything is much simpler than before, and he is even looking and integrating very basic end to end test, using the same tools that Gutenberg uses. So that&#8217;s very helpful for someone that wants to explore block development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes. Yeah. So Ryan has actually settled on Thursdays 10:30 Eastern, which is 4:30 UTC PM to do his Twitch live streaming and live coding session. So if you want to put this on your calendar, Thursdays at 10:30 on Twitch, and his&#8230;. We have the links and the show notes. His username is Ryanwelchercodes, all one word. And yeah, for those who listen and will not just keep it in memory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, yesterday, a whole new tool popped up on my radar and that is by Josh Pollock. It&#8217;s an electronic app for plugin developers to get a head start on boilerplate on. He wrote, &#8220;It can create plugins with blocks, editor sidebar, custom admin pages, remote updater, common actions and filters, custom content, post types, local development, tests, GitHub actions, and any other things.” So it&#8217;s more like an all encompassing tool. “The UI for creating plugins, managing features, modifying generated files, and downloading development versions of the plugin, is nearly done.&#8221; He wrote on his new site, &#8220;And I&#8217;m also making good progress on the CLI, I&#8217;m almost ready to start early access.&#8221; That was Josh Pollock on his websites. I signed up for the early access and I&#8217;m excited for Josh&#8217;s new app, because Josh pollock was one of the early JavaScript educators in WordPress community together with you Grzegorz, Zack and Brian Richards at WordCamp Miami in 2018, which was in spring 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Josh Pollock is also the original creator of Caldera forms that he sold in 2020 to Ninja Forms. And that plugin will reach end of life at the end of the year. It&#8217;s a shame that because it was one of the few form builders who actually offered a lot of features beyond creating forms for the end user, because other plugin developers could connect with it and create processes, for the submitted form data. So, Josh certainly knows what a plugin developer might be looking for, so will keep an eye out for this new tool that comes on the website. He also said, of course, this tool can come for free, but it&#8217;s also going to increase your or improve plug-in developer&#8217;s processes. So especially in agencies, so it definitely will be worth its investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: It sounds very intriguing. I hear for the first time about that, but I believe that Josh did great work, because he has all the necessary knowledge to do that. And he was one of the early adopters and educators in the space. So, he&#8217;s definitely someone that has credit to do this type of work. And also, it sounds really interesting to have an app that you can install on your machine. I guess it will work with Mac and with Windows, and then you will just install that and does all the job for you. Sounds very exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes, it is. Yes. Also exciting, we had a very good conversation yesterday. A lot of things happened yesterday, with Mathieu Viet, Varun Dubey and David Cavins from the BuddyPress team, when we discussed how they were converting their classic widgets to blocks and what the advantages are now, and what they learned, when they were using blocks. And one thing stood out, and I didn&#8217;t know why I wasn&#8217;t zeroing in on that, but Mathieu Viet, he mentions that he likes programming just a little block, a one unit kind of content unit. And if you stay within your own lane, you only do what this block does, and you&#8217;re not messing with everything else, like the post content or the sidebar, or any other place on the WordPress, it&#8217;s very isolated, but you can also focus on it. And I think it wasn&#8217;t really that clear to me until you said it, but that see atomic nature of the blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he&#8217;s also said that it&#8217;s so much easier now setting up a BuddyPress site for end users, because they see, they just drag the blocks over and it just works. Yeah. And they don&#8217;t have to learn short codes or widgets and all that, because&#8230; Yeah, I think David said that widgets are very hard for end users to grasp the concept of that and to apply it to their site building. So it was an interesting conversation. We will have the YouTube video, the recording available in the show notes, and also some of the tools and the resources that they mentioned, how they got into it and what helped them to move forward with the blocks. Yeah, and now we come to Gutenberg 11.8.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 11.8</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes, the last one that goes into WordPress 5.9 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes, the second last.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes, second last.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, Vincente Canales has managed to release for this version and highlights plenty of great features in the release post on the make blog. And it had 166 PRs merged, excluding all the mobile version PRs that were released, and it has 80 enhancements. We are not going to talk about all of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, 80, it&#8217;s an impressive number. And it&#8217;s for real. And a lot of those enhancements are really great, so we should start right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So the&#8230; go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. You probably wanted to say something there, it&#8217;s like there&#8217;s a lot of integration with global styles and this product evolves so fast, and it really gives a lot of power to block developers, because you just need to provide one entry in the JSON file, and suddenly you have this feature enabled. So this way is like, now you can add spacing controls to all heading blocks, which is pretty interesting that you can now control the margin or padding depending on your needs. So it&#8217;s under the dimension section in the sidebar of your block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Well, that&#8217;s one that was missing for a long time for the spacing part. I think the most used block was actually the spacer block, to make up for the missing pieces there. But now many blocks have actually the space controls and blocks like the buttons block, where you have inner blocks, as you have the buttons block outside, and then you have multiple buttons inside the block. You also have a vertical margin support and the gap. So you can, and we also saw that last version 11.7, the columns had that as well. So this is going to be rolled out also to the feature image and block, and those other blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, in general, the idea is that most of the blocks to occupy the full role, they need to have some ways to declare spacing. So you don&#8217;t have to use the spacer block anymore. And that&#8217;s the most important change. And I think at the time of the release, we also have the space gap. However, the name which will stick at the end of take this gap, will be also in all blocks that group other blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So the category block got an enhancement by supporting now only top level categories. So when you use the categories you can change that, the column block has now this specification that you can actually have specifications for the blocks within the columns. So which we&#8217;re allowed and which are not, and all that. And also how they are placed into the columns, there&#8217;s a common content block that now has typography color and pattern support. And then there were quite a few changes to the cover block, and it has now the allowed blocks and template block attributes for the cover blocks. So you, as a developer and theme developer can now determine what the cover block can entail. That&#8217;s through the block.json right from the cover block, or is it through theme or both?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I guess this is from through the block attribute, so you can define that. So for instance, when you are using a block pattern, then you can encode that, and you can set a lock now for the block, so once that is like combined together, the user won&#8217;t have a way to change that, so you have a very nice control on how those block will behave after they&#8217;re inserted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I just looked at the PR and it&#8217;s through the blocks register block type area there. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah, that&#8217;s something that a lot of theme developers and plugin developers are really worried about, is how they can control and block things down, especially when you do development for a larger editor team. So they are guided through their editing experience there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, I think those APIs will major soon because we have so many use cases for that these days, and those features are added. And as soon as we have enough blocks to make a good decision, then this API will be improved, and this is how it all happens in the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. So for the features, we now also have a new embed integration is for Pinterest, that was missing as it looks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And it was also added to core, so the embed provider is also available for classic editor, not only the block for the block editor, it&#8217;s a new variation on the embed block. I just want to go back just a little bit to the cover block, there were also so a few changes and gradual changes to the opacity for background colors. So now you could have a background color, or a background image, and then the opacity of that, you are really in control of it. There are dim ratios and they have controls over that. And that&#8217;s really good way when you create more creative block patterns. What we have seen for instance from Tammie Lister, she has a few block patterns, the pattern inspiration, and this is a place where I go when I need a little bit inspiration, is she had a background and then an image on it, and then a duotone attached to it, and made that a block pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s really fascinating, what you can do with those tools already, in terms of your visual layouts on your post or pages. So yeah, just saying that, yeah. It&#8217;s now in the plugin available now. So feature image got more spacing controls for the image block, and also the heading while we talked about this, but what I missed talking about the heading, was that it also now auto generates heading anchors. So you can, when you create subheaders, you can get a link to those subheaders that you can use, not only to drive people to end and say, okay, check out this little header there, or section of my blog post, or of my page, it also enables the finishing the table of content block that has been in process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: On hold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; on hold for quite a while, until that feature is actually available. And I read a little bit through the PR, and if it is already at anchor, it will not override it. So in your existing pages and posts, don&#8217;t worry that some automation is now making your work redundant or make your work more, it only creates new anchors and not override existing anchors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, it&#8217;s just to ensure that every heading has an anchor, that is already rendered on the front end. So you can use as URLs, but also you can provide your own name, I guess so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, you can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: The last version I saw it was working this way, so it&#8217;s very flexible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I really love that, but sometimes you have longer blog posts, but then you only want to kind of have share one paragraph of it or one quote or yeah, kind of put a heading on it, and you get an auto generated anchor for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s also, sometimes you have to write a very long heading and then just autogenerate writes out of the text, how the heading is, the anchor how it&#8217;s named. So it&#8217;s also very good experience for the user because they don&#8217;t have to type almost the same name again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right, yeah. So there are some other things I wanted to just point out, the post comment author, now add link settings, and to the block support as well as the comment dates, those are also link&#8230; I always like links, yeah. It&#8217;s kind of….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Because you can link both, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: For the author that links to the website that is provided in the user&#8217;s profile, and for the date, that&#8217;s just getting through to the comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And to the comments of that date, yeah. And then there&#8217;s some&#8230; Now we come to the more theme-related blocks, the site. Well, the comment author and data already important for the theme, the site logo received some improvements. And now there is a basic example in the site logo block. And there was some interesting back and forth on the reset button and the replace, the menu drop down, and then back and forth. But it works now really nicely, all this back and forth had the benefit that everybody who worked on it now has a better hands on how the site logo works, and how it can be added to the navigation block or to the head up block and head on template part. All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: And there are also changes to the social links or social icons. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s the name, but the titles use both versions. And so the change there is that you can now set the top and bottom margin for those icons, and the other change, there is some changes to the styling. So when you have only logos, you don&#8217;t display any texture, then it looks better than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It got a Polish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Polish, a Polish slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: A Polish slack. It&#8217;s not in polish. No, of course we are making a pun here from Polish and polish, it&#8217;s a polish logo style. But sometimes when you travel in multiple languages, these things kind of pop up at you at very different times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the global styles, and they&#8217;re now called styles. So yeah in language, in 5.9, you will see that everybody&#8217;s only talking about site styles, not the global styles, but the big change is now that the child theme, JSON file will be merged with a parent theme, JSON file. And that is important because a lot of people think about&#8230; yeah. So when you always have to build a child theme, so when the parent theme gets an update, things are not overwritten, and you can change some of the settings in the same JSON file in your child&#8217;s name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it applies to styles on top of those from the parent theme. And you can&#8230; so the parent space is maintained. If no theme.JSON file is present as child theme, all the parents standards are applied, or the other way around, because you can actually use the theme.JSON file and classic themes. So it works, yeah. If you have a classic theme, you can create a child theme and then put a theme.JSON file in it to configure all the settings for the block editor. So that&#8217;s a very good enhancement, and I&#8217;m glad that it will make it into 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. Because theme.JSON file is about the styling, and to specify that a given theme is a block theme, you need to provide templates in a special folder. That&#8217;s the distinction. It might be a bit confusing, even for me wrapping a head around that is a bit hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I don&#8217;t think that is the last word yet spoken in on the parent theme, the child theme, because we really need to consider that this is the first version where a block theme is actually in core or as a default theme in core, and the handling of a block theme will be in core with 5.9, but it&#8217;s the first version. And as you listeners probably have already noticed, there&#8217;s always the minimal and a first version to get the functionality right, and then iterate fast on it. And what&#8217;s going to happen also with the block themes, and the handling of it in terms of extensibility and all backwards compatibility. So, always through the….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: We can move to&#8230; you know we are not done yet. We can move to patterns and a big change there, that there is now a new category which feature patterns that come from the pattern directory that is hosted on wordpress.org. So, that&#8217;s a big change because now the patterns that are submitted by the community, they are somehow, I don&#8217;t know, selected to the special category, and every website that is using the block editor will be able to show them on the list, and user will be able to insert them directly from the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: From the inserter, yes. And there&#8217;s also a change in the query loop block, where the number of items per page for the default block has actually increased. So it&#8217;s not only six, but you can change that as well. The query loop block pattern. It&#8217;s one of my most favorite block patterns, because that&#8217;s where you show your….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> The query loop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s so extensible and it&#8217;s&#8230; well, so flexible that you can really make a lot of different pages out of it and showcase your content. So the block editor also got animations for the insertion point and drop zones and other elements. So the drag and drop improvements have been merged there. I didn&#8217;t see anything, well, the template editor itself, it comes totally&#8230; it&#8217;s out of experimentation for this third version, I think. And you get a lot of different updates there, as one of them is to now handle template areas with the template inspector, and have more options for them. And the other one is there for just some cosmetic items, and now it uses a dark background, but though if you have a light background on your theme, yeah, you hardly see it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s going to be a&#8230; the background of the editor is not white, it&#8217;s actually black. I don&#8217;t know if it makes a difference. And then the components, there were quite a few update on the story book. That&#8217;s a place where you can look up components, and see the attributes and how they change, and you can kind of copy and paste code from there. So that&#8217;s as good that there are some nice updates there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. And I also notice that change in the navigation block, that is going out of experimental phase. So, on the mobile screen, if you use that block, you would see the hamburger icon. So now, the changes that you can also enforce then on the desktop or the wider screens, you can also always show this hamburger. It&#8217;s something that, for instance, some Twenty Twenty family of themes, they use that feature very often. So that&#8217;s interesting change that user can use now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Absolutely, yeah. And then there are some, the great block package, got some changes and one of them is really helpful for people using that to create blocks, as it allows now local directory to pass to a template as a relative path. So, you don&#8217;t have to submit your template to NPM to actually use it in your grade block. You can just have it in a particular directory on your own machine, and reuse it for the next one of your grade block features here. And the pascal case, you can now have a Pascal case slug on your template strings as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: So that changes mostly for using PHP classes. So it follows the conversion. So you can just use that to start your class name, and then provide the rest of the class name if you are using a PHP file in your templates. So those two features are related to each other. If you are using those templates and you can build local folder with templates that generates PHP files. And I think there&#8217;s one more thing I wanted to mention. So the one is, last time we talked that for the navigation block, there was a change that allowed using a slash inserter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you need to make inserting a certain type of blocks easier in the navigation menu. And this feature was extended now for the heading list and core blocks. So, for the heading it looks quite funny because if you are using H2, then the font is big, but you are able quickly to insert a different block from that as well. So, sometimes it could be useful to do this type of operation. Maybe in the future, the slash insert might support a different type of action. So, I saw some explorations that could use machine learning. So it could like for instance, Siri or Cortana just to understand what you want to say. And like you could start typing, like insert heading with, find me a pattern with certain characteristics. So I&#8217;m looking forward to how the slash inserter will evolve now that it can be used in more places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. The slash inserter was actually the&#8230; it has been around since the beginning of Gutenberg, and it has a few nice for the post editor, but I didn&#8217;t realize that you actually have to enable it also for the other screens. And I saw that PR in the list and I didn&#8217;t highlight it, because it&#8230; hmm, I didn&#8217;t understand it quite what the significance was this time around, but now thank you for explaining it to me. I also know that some of the tools that deal with the second brain editing, like Roam Research or Logseq, they use the slash command also to add a to do list item, or to add a to do list to a certain date, or just kind of reference date. So there&#8217;s a lot that can be done with slash insert, the slash commands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for the heading, if you use it in your post, just a little secret from the treasure chest of your Birgit’s secrets, if you say slash H3, it actually gives you a heading three. So you don&#8217;t have to control the heading through the block tool or H5. Yeah, you can do that as well. But now we going back to our changelog here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there were 42 bug fixes in that release, and I&#8217;m pretty sure there are quite a few coming up also in the next release. There was actually none that really stand out where I said, okay, that took a long time to fix, or that makes it now much easier or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s definitely in recent releases, we have so many new features and enhancements that show up, that is really hard to find a bug fix that stands out. And those are small things or some something that is a bit of improvement, it&#8217;s not like sometimes it&#8217;s hard to classify. And many of them are related to how it displayed visually inside the editor, because with so many the features you sometimes miss something less important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I think in total they make a real improvement on the quality of life, of the experience, kind of the workflow. But when you isolate them to just one line item, then it&#8217;s not that clear how the improvement really affects a normal user in the block editor. But I&#8217;m always looking out for those items that are kind of significant in that area, but I didn&#8217;t see one in this one in that regard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, just in the meantime. So during the Go/No-Go Meeting that was held two weeks ago, Helen Hou-Sandi she mentioned that the biggest difference for her is that, the editor that was a couple months back, feels less buggy, like the experience overall has improved, not because something significantly changed, but because those small interaction has been improved a lot. And the difference between what you see in the block editor and on the front end doesn&#8217;t differ so much, and that&#8217;s the biggest change. This is where those little bug fixes come from, and as you pointed out in isolation, they don&#8217;t seem significant, but the amount of work done is really important, because it improves the first impression for the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Absolutely, yeah. Thank you for pointing it out. I heard Helen saying that as well, also in the discussion that we had with her, and Mark Jaquith and Riad Benguella, that the block editor has come such a long way now, that the underlying structure, as well as the look and feel and the usage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So we come to a documentation, there are 21 changes in documentation. Of course, some of the things with new features comes new documentation, and there&#8217;s now a section on how to use this theme in JSON schema, that we mentioned above, and also update the block categories and the clarifying documentation about the inner blocks orientation prop, and what else? So, there&#8217;s some package documentation updated, and quite a few components didn&#8217;t have any read-me files. And that made it hard to have the automated documentation flow that goes from the GitHub repo into the WordPress meta site on the make block a little harder. And when the information is not in the code, it can&#8217;t be in the documentation either. So there&#8217;s, well, quite a few efforts there to bring the information out of the components into the documentation there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, to fill the missing gaps, because there are still a few, however, it has improved significantly in the last few weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm-hmm. And that also covers the grade block documentation that has been updated with the new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Code Quality</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: And there were also code quality related changes, and there are 17 of that, and it&#8217;s related to maintenance and to bring some libraries up to date, or replace some libraries. So one of the works is to replace tiny color libraries, color D, which is more up to date and is a better fit for the project. And also part of the change to the color picker, that had some refactorings and it looks a bit different than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Do you know why the color picker was changed? Was it&#8230; I think we discussed it, that we both were kind of….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I still know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> But yes, and performance, and also flexibility of the new library.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tools</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay. And then there were some 11 changes to the tooling or for tools. And these are way over my head anyway, but then I only marvel at the nice naming there, which is now we have flaky test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Flaky test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Which kind of isn&#8217;t funny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: There is a tool, so maybe not tool. So when end to end tests fail, there is a special script that processes those failures. And it tries the test, if the test succeeds on the second or third attempt, then there is an issue opened called flaky tests, and it just reports what went wrong. So someone could look at that and try to fix the failure, or decide that is not an issue and close that one. So that&#8217;s the backstory for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm-hmm. Well, that&#8217;s very interesting, yes. Well, thank you for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. I think we reached to the end of the list, and we can now talk about what&#8217;s in active development, or discussed in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. And they have….</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: And I think he wanted to talk about project APTA is that, people shared on the core editor meeting on Wednesday, which is very related to the upcoming FeatureFreeze.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. And first this was about the navigation block and navigation editor. You might remember the listeners that the navigation editor screen won&#8217;t make it into 5.8, and the navigation block has been scaled down a bit for that. And the architecture of the navigation block has changed a little bit, because now it will be saved as a&#8230; the storage of it has been changed. And there are some&#8230; it&#8217;s underlying architecture, and it&#8217;s interesting that it&#8217;s very late in the process for these to come in, but the team feels quite confident to get this, get through it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: So are you talking about the idea to use a new post type or WP_template? WP_navigation to solve the navigation issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that PR has already been merged, so it&#8217;s not in this version, but it&#8217;s in the next version, so it can go get into 5.9, and it allows the same navigation items to be used in multiple places on a site, but with a potential to have each different visual presentation. So the that&#8217;s kind of how they approach it. So you could have a menu in your header and footer, but if you use it on the sub-site, and just want to point it out, you can style it differently, but you use the same links. You only have one place to edit that. And then with it comes also the facilitation of the WP navigation area as a part of the facilitating that from the classic menus. So it preserves its nature on theme switch, that&#8217;s one of the hard things that are now in the work that theme switching should not make you have to redo your menus and your navigation from the website, and that&#8217;s part of the feature parity with the existing one. And then here have some transforms on the links, and they split up the URL and the text in the link. So it can have a rich preview as well. So that was for the navigation editor reports. Do you want to talk about the template editor or the styles?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: For the template editor?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: So, I think that the template editor is a template part editor is the thing that had a lot of iterations, like the focus mode, which displays this template part inside, like removes everything that is not the template part from the view, so you can focus on that. And yeah, it seems like it&#8217;s almost there, and it will be moved out of the experimental phase, and you&#8217;ll launch in WordPress 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Did I miss anything there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: No, there was a tracking issue, that&#8217;s actually what is linked there to the template focus mode by Matias, and he had quite a few issues from the design issues that need to be merged, before it all comes together. And it&#8217;s still pretty hard to have the template editor, template part editing should work. And the overview issue has also been closed. So all the things that were in the works have actually been merged, and this overview issue has been closed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. When we talked about improvements to the template part editor last time, it looked pretty solid for me. So, I&#8217;m not surprised that it has been closed since then. And also it&#8217;s very interesting that this navigation will have its own post type, the same applies for the template part. In some ways they could use this template far for navigation, but I think it&#8217;s conceptually different, that&#8217;s why they decided that should be a different post type.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I think so, that it&#8217;s a single purpose of concern, I think it&#8217;s a better approach than mixing things, just because they&#8217;re technically similar, it doesn&#8217;t have to be that they are same. We have a similar discussion actually between reusable blocks, block patterns, and template parts. And to figure out the differences and what&#8217;s the same, because the end users will have that question as well. And there is a big discussion on how to rename the reusable blocks, and to what name, but it&#8217;s not&#8230; I don&#8217;t think it has come to an end yet, so we can&#8217;t link it in the show notes, I think it&#8217;s ongoing right now for two weeks, but yeah, any opinion is welcome, and every reasoning is welcome, in terms of how this should be called. But what I also learned about in that discussion was that there is definitely quite confusion, or it&#8217;s not particularly clear the purpose of each of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So reading through that has quite a bit of that. That can be&#8230; oh, that&#8217;s why epiphany is in there. So, I think I also read another discussion somewhere, I forgot, that&#8217;s my life now, I read something and then I forget where I have, and when I read it, I bookmark it, but then I still, if I don&#8217;t know where the bookmarks are, I&#8217;m at the same place. So, I have not yet found a solution to it, but I will navy through.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jorge posted an update on their global styles in the meeting. And they have a PR that actually propose a new color palette editor. So it makes multiple color palettes from different sources available to the user. And that&#8217;s actually also something that came out of the Go/No Go Meeting, when the team in there was thinking about how can this be improved or what&#8217;s the next step for it, when they showed the color sidebar for a template editing screen. I think it was something that Matt Mullenweg just had loaded outside. Oh, isn&#8217;t there a website out there like color palette.com where you can select different color palettes? And wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if we could get it in? So I&#8217;m definitely looking through those PRs and see how they&#8217;re progressing there or what they suggest in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes. Similar cases for the patterns, explorer, and a new way to browse them, it would be in the modal. So the exploration that is in very advanced phase now, just provides an icon that you can click in the sidebar, and it just moves all the patterns to the modal and you have almost full screen to see them, and so that should help to pick your pattern, like spend more time and have better preview of them, not limited by the very narrow space that the sidebar gives you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh yeah, you&#8217;re right, that&#8217;s a big underscore exploration now, because most page builders have that, third party page builders, and also early layout block plugins collections had some of the full model Windows to select full page patterns. When you come to full page patterns, you need a bigger space to display than the&#8230; Sidebar preview is definitely not going to be enough. Well, that&#8217;s in the discussion, what else do we have? One of preparing for the WordPress 5.9, the technical leads for the editor release leads, Robert Anderson and George Mamadashvili, are conducting an audit of experimental APIs of the various Gutenberg packages that need to come out of experimental to be merged with core. And they have a one issue list that&#8217;s 35920 is the issue number. And it&#8217;s a list of quite a few experimental methods and APIs, but only a few of them. And I know there are a few developers who actually created the features, are already preparing those to come out of experiment. They&#8217;re working on that. This is just the issue list with all the experimental methods, and when you go through the comments, you&#8217;ll see which one are already work in progress to be bring out of experiment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. Just wanted to explain what this experimental status means for those methods. So, as long as they&#8217;re experimental, then there is no guarantee that this method will have the same signatures. So, plugin developers, or theme developers, they use it and at their own risk, it happens, but those&#8230; I know that people who use that, they pay attention to ensure that, as long as it&#8217;s stabilized, they update their codes. So it still works as they should. And yeah, so the idea is that as soon as you change the name and remove this underscore experimental prefix, the method gets integrated with the block editor handbook and all the like method name, description, patterns, they get included there so people can easily find them later. So it&#8217;s just a way to ensure that the Gutenberg plugin can move very fast, and check out if given API makes sense, and use that with core, usually with the block editor or with the block library for core blocks, and it worked pretty nice. However, the list of experiments has grown over time, and probably it would be a good idea to soon take step back and clarify what the future of some of those APIs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Will be, yeah, absolutely. Speaking, coming out of experimental, the new gallery block will come out of experimental for 11.9. It was a little bit delayed because when found that there was a problem with the mobile app, if you have a lower mobile app than 18.2, there was some content loss there. So now there is a little notification on the gallery block placeholder, that if you have a different mobile version, make sure that you don&#8217;t use it, so you&#8217;re not encountering any content loss. That&#8217;s the only&#8230; it is from the developers, is the estimation that by the time 6.0 comes around, the people that are on lower mobile apps have upgraded by then, and it&#8217;s not an issue anymore, but it&#8217;s just for this release, but it definitely will come to 11.9 for everybody else. And so I&#8217;m really looking forward to that, because having image blocks within your gallery, is so much easier to handle so much better concept than having images that don&#8217;t have all the features like it has now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they also have&#8230; so the developers, Glen Davis, mostly spearheaded that effort, he took care of quite a few backwards compatibility issues that happened with existing galleries, that are normally not touched, but when you open up the post again, it will be automatically changed. And we have not finished our outreach to the plugin developers yet, to alert them to that change. But most of them that we have contacted, about 15 of them, 80% actually knew about it and had already adopted their gallery extensions. All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: That&#8217;s great to hear that people are following the progress on their blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think a big part is they&#8217;re listening to our podcast. I&#8217;m just saying that now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah. And that is pretty much the end of our show. I don&#8217;t have anything else that I wanted to talk about, do you have anything Grzegorz?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: No, and other than usual stuff like, we are waiting for reviews and send us your comments, what do you like about the show? What you don&#8217;t like? So we could improve, that would be always appreciated, and you can also contact us on Twitter, like tweet us or DM us. My Twitter handle is @gziolo and yours Birgit&#8217;s is @bph, it&#8217;s very short and sweet. How did you manage to find this one? So short.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, I signed up in 2008, so very early. But I get a lot of street cred from the young-ins that I have a three digit Twitter handle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So we also have an email address where you can send your questions and suggestions, and the news, it&#8217;s <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. And this is it for me. I wish you all a great weekend. And next week, when you listen to that, we are all looking forward to WordPress 5.9 testing, and yeah, this is it until the next time, bye-bye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes, that was a great one. Thank you Birgit, and thank you our listeners, see you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Bye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 30 Oct 2021 19:15:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Birgit Pauli-Haack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WordPress Foundation: The WordPress Foundation publishes its 2020 financials\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/?p=201436\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/2021/the-wordpress-foundation-publishes-its-2020-financials/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4205:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">We are glad to announce that WordPress Foundation has published its financials for the year 2020. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, the WordPress Foundation and its subsidiary B-Corp (WordPress Community Support, PBC) provided support and guidance for a total of 33<a href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/\">&nbsp;WordCamps</a>&nbsp;and hundreds of<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\">&nbsp;Meetup groups</a>, organized by volunteers in communities all over the world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Foundation’s total revenue in 2020 was $10,787, with donations making up all of this amount.

This month we feature a WordPress e-commerce specialist on the difference it makes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Empowered to make a change</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For WordPress contributor Ronald Gijsel, open source is a lifeline and a perfect place for people with creative minds. It led him on a transformational journey from chef to WordPress e-commerce specialist. Originally from the Netherlands, where he trained in hospitality, he was to find a restorative and energizing power within the WordPress local and global community. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ten years ago, life took a sad turn for Ronald and his wife Nihan when their baby daughter passed away only a few days after she was born. At that time, Ronald was a restaurant owner in the UK, working hard in a challenging economic environment.&nbsp;Discovering open source was in many ways his lifeline and helped him and his wife through their considerable heartache. Through this community, a journey to understand the opportunities of the web and new career paths began.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/ronaldgijsel2-1.jpg?w=632&ssl=1\" alt=\"Portrait picture of Ronald Gijsel\" class=\"wp-image-11403\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald believes that working together in WordPress and other open source communities can lead to massive benefits for a large number of users. Not least, an online presence has been essential to the survival of many businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During recent years, he has visited open source events worldwide as a partnership manager at a WordPress e-commerce plugin company and community supporter. His enthusiasm for WordPress has steered him to being part of local support, solutions and collaboration as a co-organizer of <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp</a> Bristol, the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Cheltenham-WordPress-Meetup/\">WordPress Cheltenham Meetup</a> and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Moving forward&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When Nihan enrolled in the UK&#8217;s Open University to complete her computer science degree, Ronald found her course materials stirring his own interest. He started to follow the lectures with her and even attempted some of the course work for himself &#8211; all whilst he continued to work as a chef in various local pubs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through this, he discovered how to generate affiliate commission earnings through blogging on different platforms. “Creating websites was slowly becoming a passion. In these first few years, I enjoyed every part of the steep learning curve, from tackling the basics to more advanced coding and designs,” said Ronald.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Start of a Web Career</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald reduced his hours as a chef and devoted more time to online courses learning coding, e-commerce, SEO, and online marketing. Yet when he applied for a job as a WordPress designer, he had only heard of the platform in the context of blogging. This was all to change when an online tutor on one of the training sites revealed the many functions available with WordPress. It was the start of a new career and life journey. This tutor was Topher DeRosia, who went on to create <a href=\"https://heropress.com/\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"632\" height=\"467\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/with-topher.jpg?resize=632%2C467&ssl=1\" alt=\"Ronald Gijsel and Topher De Rosia at \na WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-11398\" />Ronald with Topher at WordCamp London in 2019\n\n\n\n<p>To learn WordPress, Ronald ‘binge-watched’ webinars on various development topics and over time he became more familiar with it. Securing a job as a designer was only the beginning of his journey into the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year later in 2015, after landing the job as a WordPress designer, Ronald&#8217;s boss asked him to consider taking on the business and its clients. With his wife, Ronald decided to take on the firm and to expand their work in WordPress e-commerce and online marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an advocate for learning new skills and practicing them, Ronald encourages others to continue to expand their knowledge through study, attending talks at Meetups and WordCamps, and using the new <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress resource</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“WordPress has evolved in so many branches that require different skills. There are hundreds of areas of expertise, roles, and jobs that complement WordPress to make it what it is.”</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\"><img width=\"528\" height=\"652\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/meetup3-1.jpg?resize=528%2C652&ssl=1\" alt=\"Ronald talking about WordPress and e-commerce solutions\" class=\"wp-image-11414 size-full\" /><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">“WordPress is an essential tool in my box.”<br /><em><strong>Ronald Gijsel</strong></em></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald believes WordPress thrives on diversity, with many <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">contributor opportunities</a> and jobs in the ecosystem that require a wide range of skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A big part of this is that each person’s personal background complements their skill sets. Who you are and what you do is influenced by what you have done and learned. We need to cherish this. These things also add to our culture, language, experience, and knowledge,” he said.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A journey into WordPress e-commerce</h2>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/meetup2.jpg?resize=632%2C442&ssl=1\" alt=\"Ronald presenting on WordPress and e-commerce at an event\" class=\"wp-image-11400\" width=\"632\" height=\"442\" />Ronald shares his enthusiasm for building WordPress and e-commerce websites at WordCamp London in 2019\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald initially extended his interest in the&nbsp;WordPress ecosystem through representing a plugin company at WordCamps in the UK. He became hooked and went on to attend events in many different countries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, he realized he could do more with his connections and create meaningful partnerships. Within a few weeks, he had crafted his dream job and sent a proposal to the CEO of a WordPress e-commerce firm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But pitching to strangers wasn’t an easy task, as he did not know if they would understand his vision. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald said: “The doubts went through my head for months. ‘Do I give up my business and work for the benefit of another company? What if I don’t get on? What do I do with my customers?’ But I decided to take the leap.&#8221; His pitch proved successful, joining his current firm in 2019.<br /><br />In the firm’s CEO, Ronald found a mentor, supporter, and a friend. He explained: “Nando Pappalardo never tells me what to do, but instead, he asks questions to make me realize what is achievable, or could be even better. He simply makes suggestions that I read something and reach my own conclusions.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Looking back at the journey&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking risks or changing directions in mid-career often involves a giant leap. In Ronald&#8217;s view, through WordPress, you don&#8217;t need to be alone. He believes its community can offer support and help to process thinking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald said: “I often think back to the moment my daughter passed away. She only lived for a few days. Every day, I wonder how events would have unfolded if she had survived. Maybe her memory lives on in every decision I make and the paths I decide to take.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From his experience, he found that&nbsp;changing a career can sometimes take a few years and have a period of transition. He said: “Only looking back do I realize that each small step slowly made a difference in my life.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>“It was WordPress that made the online world easier to navigate and empowered me to make a change”&nbsp;</p><cite>Ronald Gijsel</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “Feeling welcomed into the WordPress community through Meetups and WordCamps added a human dimension and confidence that I can do ‘this’ too.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald’s wish is that his story will offer support to others who may have experienced tragedy in their lives. “I hope that I can give you the hope and strength to try and put your energy into something else that can lead to more significant changes in your life. Try to take it as one positive decision at a time.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help us share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community.&nbsp;Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series.</a>&nbsp;#ContributorStory.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">@</a><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">webcommsat</a>), and Surendra Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\">@sthakor</a>) for the interviews and writing this feature, and to Ronald Gijsel (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/just2ronald/\">@just2ronald</a>) for sharing his story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Meher Bala (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\">@meher</a>), Chloé Bringmann (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\">@cbringmann</a>), Anjana Vasan (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/anjanavasan/\">@anjanavasan</a>), Collieth Clarke (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/callye/\">@callye</a>), and Reyes Martinez (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/rmartinezduque/\">@rmartinezduque</a>) for their content contributions, and Josepha Haden Chomphosy (@<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">chanthaboune</a>), and Topher DeRosia (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\">@topher1kenobe</a>) for their support for the series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This People of WordPress feature is inspired by an essay originally published on </em><a href=\"https://heropress.com/\"><em>HeroPress.com</em></a><em>, a community initiative created by Topher DeRosia.

We discussed it before, navigation menus are super important for site owners, as they guide the site visitor through the site. WordPress&#8217; plugins are extending in many ways the menus and front end. The first version of the navigation block will not offer any additional extension and will be used in a block theme made for Full-site-Editing. It will not be part of the main navigation for classic themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gutenberg 11.8 </strong>is now available in the WordPress repository. <strong>Vicente Canales</strong> published the release and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/10/28/whats-new-in-gutenberg-11-8-0-27-october/\">Make Blog post</a>: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/10/28/whats-new-in-gutenberg-11-8-0-27-october/\"><strong>What’s new in Gutenberg 11.8</strong></a> You&#8217;ll find instructional short videos as demos for some features. My favorite new feature is the auto-generated Anchors for Headings and the opacity controls for background in the Cover block.

There were 166 PRs merged in total, and the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v11.8.0\">changelog lists 80 Enhancements</a>. 🎉</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grzegorz Ziolkowski </strong>and I  recorded the Gutenberg Changelog episode #54 on Friday, and it will be published over the weekend.

Many of the block themes released in the past year have been little different than your typical starter theme. However, there is a quiet momentum building that might just surprise some folks in a few months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic has put out several block themes. However, its themes tend to fit into a specific mold that caters toward its WordPress.com users. Many of the company&rsquo;s employees are active in the Gutenberg project, and it has massive resources to throw at theme dev. It can push forward all it wants, and it certainly has with its <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-automattic-theme-team-announces-blockbase-its-new-block-parent-theme\">Blockbase parent theme</a>. Automattic&rsquo;s Theme Team has already launched four child themes: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/seedlet-blocks/\">Seedlet (Blocks)</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/mayland-blocks/\">Mayland (Blocks)</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/quadrat/\">Quadrat</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/geologist/\">Geologist</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, it will take other theme authors and shops to move the ball forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/first-look-at-wordpress-upcoming-twenty-twenty-two-default-theme-the-most-flexible-default-theme-ever-created-for-wordpress\">Twenty Twenty-Two is already shaping up</a> to be a beautiful default theme that will showcase the power of global styles and block patterns. Development began so late that it will take a full-speed sprint to wrap it up for the WordPress 5.9 launch in December. My primary concern with the time crunch is that some of the little details that make great designs get overlooked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I have seen enough of the work that has gone into this theme to believe it will be one of the best default themes in years.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Twenty Twenty-Two homepage.\n\n\n\n<p>For block themes to work, people must find those that they want to use on their sites. The designs must be representative of their personality or style. Or, they must offer features or layouts that match what they need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That takes time, and it takes more theme authors jumping on the block bandwagon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could see a little of it with Anariel Design&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/anariel-design-launches-naledi-a-block-based-wordpress-theme\">Naledia</a> and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/clove-a-showcase-of-block-patterns-by-anariel-design\">Clove</a> themes earlier this year. They were beautiful designs but did not fit me.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Clove theme homepage.\n\n\n\n<p>Then, Anders Nor&eacute;n <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/tove-a-block-based-wordpress-theme-by-anders-noren\">released Tove last month</a>. It was a bit funky, eclectic. Most of all, it was something fresh. And it did not rely on any components of traditional theming. What stood out was its 40+ block patterns, which offered just a little something for everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the moment where I started seeing the shift in parts of the community. Having one of its most well-known theme authors build on top of the new system shows that maybe this whole block-based theme system <em>might</em> actually be worth exploring.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom-built homepage with Tove.\n\n\n\n<p>I still could not see myself using Tove. It is a well-built theme but not my cup of tea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this week, I briefly mentioned the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/bai/\">Bai theme</a> by Seed Webs in a post about a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-pattern-block-and-how-it-fixes-a-longstanding-issue-with-dynamic-data-in-html-templates\">potential Pattern block</a>. Unlike Tove, it was far less experimental with its style &mdash; a bit more down to earth. As I browsed its <a href=\"https://bai.seeddemo.com/\">demo</a> blog posts, I saw something of myself in it. There were things I disliked, such as the animations when scrolling down the page. However, the heavy focus on the written word and the color scheme drew me in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still dabble a bit in design and development. This helps me understand what the system is capable of in the right hands. I know that even more complex and unique designs are possible within the block framework that we have now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am also a WordPress user. Until Bai, no other theme had come along that spoke to that side of me that wants to install something and just blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Single post view of the Bai theme.\n\n\n\n<p>It also resembled traditional themes on the outside. This is crucial because other theme authors must see something that more closely resembles what they might build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a dig at the pioneers who built the earliest block themes dating back to 2020, but many were not particularly eye-catching projects. The underlying technology was fun to dig through, but they were not something you could <em>sell</em> users on. The recent wave of themes is different. They show that, yes, you can build beautiful block-based designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be hard to put faith into a system until you see a little bit of yourself in it. As more and more theme authors begin exploring block themes, more users will find those designs that represent who they are or meet some other site design goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block theme journey is just beginning. It is going to be a fun ride once WordPress 5.9 launches and we hit the gas pedal.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 30 Oct 2021 01:28:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WPTavern: Jetpack Launches New Licensing Portal for Agencies\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=124870\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:165:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-launches-new-licensing-portal-for-agencies?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=jetpack-launches-new-licensing-portal-for-agencies\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2547:\"<p>Jetpack is finally formalizing its approach to <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/for/agencies/\">agency licensing</a> with a new portal <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2021/10/27/announcing-jetpack-licensing/\">launched</a> this week. The program is aimed at streamlining product setup and account billing records for agencies and professionals who use Jetpack on client projects. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dashboard shows partners their total licenses and costs at a glance. It also allows agencies to monitor clients&rsquo; backups, scans, and activity logs. This is an improvement over managing billing for licenses scattered across client sites. Once an agency is approved for the program, Jetpack representatives will migrate existing plans into the same account. An agency&rsquo;s clients can then all be rolled into one monthly bill. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The Jetpack licensing portal is the first solution we&rsquo;ve launched to address licensing for agencies or professionals that manage multiple sites,&rdquo; said Jesse Friedman, who manages Strategic Marketing and Partnerships for Jetpack. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time focused on making it easier for customers to setup and get started with Jetpack.&nbsp;This licensing platform streamlines that setup flow specifically for agencies.&nbsp;They will be able to issue a license, and have Jetpack backing up or scanning a site in moments, by eliminating the checkout flows and reducing multiple monthly bills into one single invoice.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first in a new line of products targeted at agencies and Jetpack is incentivizing signups with tiered discounts for more licenses. There was some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redcrew/status/1453714014878539781\">confusion about the pricing</a> but a Jetpack representative said the discounts apply to the <a href=\"https://cloud.jetpack.com/pricing\">regular product pricing</a>. There is no cost for agencies to sign up but they are required to&nbsp;issue 5 licenses within 90 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our hope is to attract agencies who use Jetpack today so we can address the needs they have right now,&rdquo; Friedman said.&nbsp;&ldquo;We wanted to create some minimal requirements to use the platform in order to ensure a positive experience.&nbsp; If an agency signs up and doesn&rsquo;t end up issuing 5 licenses within 90 days they may not benefit from the platform or the tools we are hoping to build for them and we&rsquo;d recommend they continue using the Jetpack products the same way they use them today.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 21:56:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"WPTavern: WordCamp US Seeks New Host City for 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=124966\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:145:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-seeks-new-host-city-for-2022?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordcamp-us-seeks-new-host-city-for-2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2988:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/wordcamp-us-update-city-search-2022/\">search for a host city</a> for WordCamp US 2022 is now underway with what WordPress community organizer Angela Jin calls &ldquo;big changes&rdquo; to the selection process. Unlike previous years where WordPress communities applied after researching venues and demonstrating activity and interest, community leadership plans to conduct its own city search.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We all felt that requesting applications from local WordPress communities today would place an undue burden on volunteers,&rdquo; Jin said. &ldquo;Risk evaluation and forecasting feasibility of an in-person flagship [event] requires a professional events management team.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WCUS lost money in deposits made for the event in 2020 after it was cancelled due to the pandemic. It was supposed to be held in St. Louis another year but the organizing team has decided to make a fresh start on the planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;When WordCamp US 2020 was canceled, we did explore moving the venue contract in St. Louis forward,&rdquo; Jin said. &ldquo;The negotiations didn&rsquo;t lead to anything we felt was in the best interest of the WordPress community, however, so we did cancel the contract and we lost some venue deposits.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jin said WordCamp US is one of the biggest venue contracts they manage and it made sense to bring in a professional events management team to negotiate with potential venues, given all the uncertainty surrounding in-person events right now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;They will be a part of the organizing team and help facilitate venue logistics,&rdquo; Jin said. &ldquo;Venue logistics at this scale tends to be difficult and invisible. Having a professional events team frees up our volunteer organizers to focus more on community-facing tasks. For now, though, the focus is finding and negotiating with the venue.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WCUS may or may not continue with hosting the event in the same city for two years, depending on the relationship with the venue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re asking for bids for 2022, with an option to propose for 2023,&rdquo; Jin said. &ldquo;A big part of the decision making this year is whether or not the venue will be a partner to the WCUS organizing team. For example, if we do need to cancel, we hope to see any loss minimized. On the other hand, if the situation improves, a venue that offers flexibility to help us host a larger event than we currently anticipate would be amazing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jin would not reveal which cities are under consideration for WCUS 2022 but said the team is including local communities that applied to host the event in 2020. She said many of those organizers are still interested and enthusiastic about hosting the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community team plans to put out a call for organizers in mid-November and will extend the call to more local organizers once the host city has been chosen.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 17:38:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"Post Status: The Legend Of The Headless Website with the WebDevStudios Team\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=88480\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/the-legend-of-the-headless-website-with-the-webdevstudios-team/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4163:\"<p>It\'s a haunting but educational tale with<strong> Brad Williams, Lisa Sabin-Wilson, Greg Rickaby, and Amor Kumar</strong> as they join host <strong>Cory Miller</strong> to talk about headless WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Topics:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What is a Headless WordPress Website?</li><li>Considerations when deciding if Headless is a good approach for you.</li><li>Learn how a Headless approach can be faster, more secure, and more scalable.</li><li>Supporting advanced functionality like contact forms and user input.</li><li>Recommended tools, hosting providers, and partners.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\">Every week <strong><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/podcast/the-excerpt/\">Post Status Live</a></strong> will brief you on important WordPress news — in about 15 minutes or less!

However, after a month of updates, the project seemed to fall off the radar, at least until earlier this week when he released a massive overhaul that integrates more with the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin creates a custom post type for managing individual FAQ sets. This part of the plugin uses the classic editor interface instead of relying on the block system.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Edit/New FAQ screen.\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, the experience of the classic editor is always jarring whenever I load a plugin that uses it. FAQ posts do not have a content canvas. The data is saved as meta values, so it does not necessarily need to work with the block editor. However, I would love to see a plugin such as this one move its primary interface over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The management screen is the same as posts, pages, and other post types, and adding a new FAQ is straightforward. The plugin presents users with a meta box for adding question-and-answer sets, which uses the TinyMCE interface for typing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a FAQ Group taxonomy for categorizing FAQ posts. This should come in handy for informational sites that need tighter organization. The plugin also offers a <code>[flexible-faqs]</code> shortcode, which classic users can drop in their posts and pages. However, others will want to take advantage of its blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin ships with three blocks for outputting expandable FAQ posts:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Text</li><li>Box</li><li>Accordion</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of the blocks allows end-users to select a published FAQ or a FAQ Group. They can then choose a &ldquo;theme,&rdquo; which can be customized.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Box-style FAQ with default theme.\n\n\n\n<p>Users will likely need to customize the FAQ theme because the plugin&rsquo;s output has some styles that overrule theme defaults, particularly its colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The color picker used in each block&rsquo;s options is different from core and feels out of place. However, users can still select from their theme-defined colors, except for the border setting. For some reason, the border color uses an entirely different picker control. Despite that, I was still able to get the output to line up with my theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Accordion-style FAQ with customized theme.\n\n\n\n<p>The blocks would offer a smoother user experience if they leaned on more of WordPress&rsquo;s built-in block controls and components. Using the core color and border features would be a good starting point. However, offering access to typography, full or wide-alignment, text alignment, and more would give users more flexibility with the design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not currently a fan of the three-block approach. From my tests, I do not see a reason to separate them. Each does the same thing with slightly different styles. Instead of splitting the blocks, I would like to see a single FAQ block that focuses on design controls. The plugin could still offer the three base layouts as variations that are essentially presets of specific settings &mdash; that is what the variation system is for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would drop the &ldquo;theme&rdquo; system altogether. Then, use block styles for different default designs and add extra controls for customizing more specific features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the <a href=\"https://flexiblefaqs.com/\">pro version</a> relies heavily on the plugin&rsquo;s block-theming system. While the free copy offers a handful of themes, the commercial upgrade has over 100. This is not something that would be easy to backtrack at this point. Its saving grace is that user customizations are stored in the database, and they can reuse these modified themes across the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of any nit-picks I have, the version 0.5.10 update is leaps and bounds better than the earlier versions. The plugin is dead simple to get up and running. I built a few FAQ posts and dropped them into pages within minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin is also ARIA compliant and accessible. I ran into no trouble testing it from the keyboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin&rsquo;s front-end scripts for opening and closing the tabs do not seem to load when using a block-based theme. I am not sure if this is an issue from the plugin or a bug with Gutenberg. It should not deter most users at this point, but it should be addressed before WordPress 5.9 launches with its support of block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin is not ideal for every situation. For those who have multiple FAQ pages or lists, it offers an easy route toward managing them. For sites with just one or two sections of questions and answers, it is likely overkill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the latter group, Jordy Meow&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/faq-block/\">FAQ Block</a> plugin makes a lot more sense. It allows users to build a FAQ directly in the post or page, but it does not provide a central location for managing multiple FAQs.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 03:06:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"Gutenberg Times: Discussion: Going from Creating classic themes to Building block themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=19327\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/discussion-going-from-creating-classic-themes-to-building-block-themes/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61573:\"<p>On October 7th, 2021, I had the privilege to host an amazing panel with Ellen Bauer, Andres Noren and Carolina Nymark on a Live Q &amp; A. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discussed block themes and how these three theme developers made the journey from creating classic theme, to building block themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On this post you&#8217;ll find the Video recording, the resource links shared and the transcript. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"toolbelt-video-wrapper\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-sortabrilliant-guidepost\"><ul><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#0-resources-and-links-to-learn-more\">Resources and Links to learn more</a><ul><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#1-stay-in-touch-with-the-panelists\">Stay in Touch with the Panelists</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#1-previous-live-q-amp-as-on-block-themes-and-full-site-editing\">Previous Live Q &amp; As on Block themes and Full-site Editing</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#3-t\">Theme.json resources</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#4-block-themes-for-full-site-editing\">Block Themes for Full-Site Editing</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#5-strong-tools-strong\">Tools</a><ul><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#6-th\">Theme Team experiments </a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#6-documentation\">Documentation</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#3-transcript\">The Show Transcript</a><ul><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#1-introduction-of-panelists-ellen-bauer-anders-noren-and-carolina-nymark\">Introduction of Panelists: Ellen Bauer, Anders Noren and Carolina Nymark</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#2-strong-announcement-strong\">Announcement</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#6-h\">How do theme developers move from building classic themes to building block themes?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#7-q\">Q: What kept you going through the transition?

I can shut them up because now I hear myself in five minute increments. All right, so </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi there and welcome to our 29th Gutenberg Times live Q&amp;A. My name is Birgit Pauli-Haack, and I&#8217;m your host and the curator of Gutenberg Times. Thank you all for watching. It&#8217;s so great to have you here. In today&#8217;s show, we will discuss with three outstanding theme developers how they went from building classic themes, to building block-based themes, geared towards Full-Site Editing, and let&#8217;s introduce the panelists. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-introduction-of-panelists-ellen-bauer-anders-noren-and-carolina-nymark\">Introduction of Panelists: Ellen Bauer, Anders Noren and Carolina Nymark</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We have early morning in New Zealand, Ellen Bauer, co-founder of Elma studio and with Manuel Esposito, the co-author of the A No theme. Ellen, thank you so much for being here on the show again, it&#8217;s so good to see you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen Bauer: Yes, it&#8217;s so good. Thank you. Thanks for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Also with us and for the first time on the show, Anders Noren, theme developer from Sweden and designer of the default WordPress theme Twenty Twenty. His theme Excel, probably the last classic theme from him. Palace to Gutenberg Times. It&#8217;s a pleasure to meet you, Anders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anders Noren: Twice, super happy to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: As well and finally meet Carolyn, Carolyn, Sorry, Carolina Nymark. From also from Sweden, member of the themes team, co-author of the TT one blog theme, and development lead on the Twenty Twenty-one theme. And her second Full Site Editing theme is Armando. And it&#8217;s in the WordPress directory. So glad you have your back on the show, Carolina. It&#8217;s the third time I could call you my co-host. So how are you doing today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carolina Nymark: Thank you. I&#8217;m very well. I am excited to come and talk about teams. So thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: So and we have people from Toronto. Hi, Robert. Hi, Jack. Hi, Pierre Maria, from Italy. Also star of the testing, Full-Site Editing outreach team because he translated many of the tests into Italian. And that&#8217;s a huge work. And thank you very much for that, Mario. And then of course, Brian Gardner. The minute I mentioned his name, Ellen just disappeared for the from the screen for a minute. Well, greetings back to Chicago. So, we are also excited. And for you joining us on zoom and on YouTube.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-strong-announcement-strong\">Announcement</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And yeah, so I have an announcement while I have you all. Next week. The next Gutenberg Times live Q&amp;A will be next week with Helen Hou-Sandi, Mark J. Chris and Riad Benguella. So Helen Hou-Sandi is a commiters on WordPress. So I think this Mark and Riad. Riad is also the developer lead for Gutenberg.&nbsp; They will discuss or continue our discussion that was started on Twitter some weeks ago, on how to make it easier to build blocks. All three have explored ways on how PHP and React JS could talk together to make this a better experience for developers. It will happen next week, October 14 at 11 Eastern 15 UTC, registrations are open, and I’ll share the link in the chat window. So you can kind of if you&#8217;re interested, can register there as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, Miki from Tokyo hi to Nepal. It&#8217;s good to see you all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, speaking of the questions for those who are watching this on YouTube and livestream, use the chat window on the right-hand side. I don&#8217;t know where it is. But Oh, and if you&#8217;re on zoom here, use the chat box, the Q&amp;A for the questions and the chat bubble for all your other thoughts. Please keep it family friendly. Even if you disagree. So, this is a family club so to speak. Alright, and hi, back to Atlanta to Sequester McKinney. It&#8217;s all so great to see you here. All right, so what&#8217;s today&#8217;s show about? </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"6-h\">How do theme developers move from building classic themes to building block themes?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our topic is how do theme developers move from building classic themes to building block-based themes with Full-Site Editing features that are already in WordPress 5.8 and more will come to WordPress 5.9 and WordPress 6.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Development has been going on for almost two years. And some of you might remember our previous shows here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the same spot, one in <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/theme-templates-full-site-editing-experience-enrique-piqueras/\">January 2020</a> was the first one then in June. Then again this year in January, and in June was the last one with <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/theme-json-for-wordpress-theme-authors-demo-and-live-q-a-w-daisy-olson-tammie-lister-and-jeff-ong/\">Jeff Ong, Daisy Olsen and Tammie Lister </a>where we talked very extensively about the theme JSON. And Jeff did a little demo there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you want to go back in our records on YouTube to see that so with Full-Site Editing and global styles, themes are changing in architecture, as well as in functionality, they will enable much more customization for users than ever before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> So today, we&#8217;re having that conversation with the theme developers who already walked the path before you give us in building blocks, block by seams and put them out for users to use. So Anders first and then we&#8217;ll Ellen we will have a demo of the work and to give us an overview and then by then I would think we will have already some questions from the audience from you. So before but before we go into the weeds too deep, let&#8217;s do a round robin to a question for everyone. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"7-q\">Q: What kept you going through the transition? What excites you most about block themes?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you were building the themes, you are on the cutting edge and some would say on the bleeding edge of Gutenberg development, that must have been quite stressful. So, what were the factors and situations that kept you going, and what is it that excites you so much about this new way of building themes that you kind of went through the experience, and what kept you going and jump head in first? Carolina first, then Ellen and Anders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Carolina Nymark: </em>When I first when I started it was all about having new toys to play with right, and then we would work on the Twenty-Twenty-One and TT1 Block started did one box was a little later. And yes, it was stressful. But also a lot of fun. But again we’ve got to contribute back to Gutenberg and improve on the things that we found that weren&#8217;t got they weren&#8217;t working and also figure out what features do we need to add later? What&#8217;s our wish list? And of course what is not working now, what bugs need to be fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Okay, thank you thank you for going through the bug fixing part and the testing part</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen Bauer: Hello, I need your my audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Yes, very well I can hear you</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ellen Bauer:</em> I just enjoy so Carolina was like started way longer and she did have cool Full-Site Editing website which I knew for a long time and like I knew the terms and stuff and we were kind of busy building blocks and that took up a lot of my time kind of learning getting into that part. And so it&#8217;s like back and forth switching between themes and blocks for us, which was challenging or is challenging. But the final like 5.8 the release of 5.8 was the final like straw for us and we&#8217;ve been building I know for like over a year like building kind of testing where we should go it was and it was like we felt a little bit stuck at times like what would we do.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We played around with patterns a lot and we just thought like there&#8217;s something missing with our Aino theme. And we just started the project for this whole transition. So obviously, then we had this Aino theme kind of sitting around waiting to be a black theme And with 5.9, we just kind of like, okay, we go with it. We had the theme in the WordPress org repository. And yeah, it was just always meant to be for this kind of project. So 5.8 got us ready, like there&#8217;s a site editor, let&#8217;s just try it out. And I thought it&#8217;s, I thought it will maybe take me like a few days, which was a little bit naive. And then I think it ended up being three weeks, mainly. And there&#8217;s like, still huge, like work in progress. Our like, we had the theme already on, like, the WooCommerce. And I was like, eager to get WooCommerce into the block theme. I didn&#8217;t want to lose any of our work. And yeah, there&#8217;s still like things to do. But it has WooCommerce support. And it&#8217;s kind of cool that we can jump in like right from the beginning and kind of explore what we can do and what we can&#8217;t do. And then yeah, we updated the theme as a blog theme. And we were super happy that we went this way. But then there was like, oh, there&#8217;s quite a lot of Gutenberg updates, like pushed. And I remember Carolina you said this, oh, there&#8217;s a lot of Gutenberg updates do we push, like, quite like fast, you have to be on your toes. And one of them like got me like I was like, Oh, god, what are they doing? I didn&#8217;t pay attention. I was so busy. But yeah, now it&#8217;s, I think I have it a little bit better than the control, like after the first one or two update with like, as a block theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one thing that caught me a little off guard, like transverse translating to the converting to the HTML templates, was that I didn&#8217;t realize once people use the templates, and I change something in them, that it wouldn&#8217;t change for them automatically. Because they customize them. So I and I made changes to the page templates. And so that was a little bit confusing. And I learned my lesson from that. But we have awesome. Yeah, we have awesome users. And they like I think I got it sorted out together like a lot of help. And we have a Slack channel, which is super useful. People can like shout out like, Ellen, what are you doing? I think it will be smooth. And yeah, we learn like, we learn big lessons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Oh, good. Yeah. Thank you. Anders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anders Noren:</strong> Yeah, I was gonna say that. I didn&#8217;t really feel like Trailblazer were early adopter in block teams. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because by the time I actually delved deep into it, then people like Carolina with <a href=\"https://fullsiteediting.com\">FullSiteediting.com</a> had already found the path through Full-Site Editing theme, some document that pretty much everything theme developers need to know, I feel like, actually get started with Office themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it felt like the path was very well worn by the time I actually started working on it. Because that was the like around summer this year. Whereas Carolina has been working with it for a year plus, at this point. So I feel, like pretty much everyone who works with block based teams now owe a lot to the people who really spend time with them in the early days, because it has only gotten easier to build them up up to this point. And will hopefully get a lot easier as 5.9 gets closer as well. But I mean, I&#8217;m going to echo Carolina, as well was saying that, the thing that keeps it going is just that it&#8217;s so fun to play around with all of the toys that Full-Site Editing brings. And the really fun part is when you actually release something, and other users start to use your theme. And they actually use it in ways that you didn&#8217;t imagine at all, while you were making it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a support request from a guy just the other day, who sent me a link to a site running my block-based theme. And at first, I thought that he had actually sent me the wrong link because I couldn&#8217;t recognize that as to my theme. Because the layouts were different. The colors were different. The typeface was different. So it just looked like an entirely different thing from mine. And I feel like that&#8217;s always the really exciting, but when you step in and do something completely unexpected with it. And I think We&#8217;re going to see more and more about them in this space overall, as 5.9 gets closer, but I think the next two months will be really, fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack</strong>: Yeah, definitely. Yeah. All right. So I don&#8217;t see any comments for our audience to get to. So I&#8217;m glad that you are. And thank you very much for saying that for about Carolina. And all those who worked so hard on it. Yeah, it&#8217;s nice of you to say and to acknowledge that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;s a great time now to see the finished product. First Anders, as I said, and then Ellen. And dear viewers, if you do, you probably will have questions right away. And I&#8217;m asking for a little bit of a patience, then we will switch to the Q&amp;A after the demos. And a note, if you write long blog posts before you get to your question, I’d probably skip it, as it will be too long to read first for me and then aloud, and I will get you an answer after the show. Promised is Andrea Middleton wrote, Be kind be brief. So Anders, are you ready to share your screen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anders Noren:</strong> Yes, let&#8217;s do it. There we go. So I thought I was gonna keep this pretty simple and just show a little bit from my block face theme, which is called tool that after the after two rounds on the finish, creator of the Roman characters, and basically give a brief overview of power block-based site running a block based team can look like. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as I said earlier, it can really look like anything, which is the whole point of block-based themes in the first place. So what we have here is the demo site for the theme Tove, which is on wordpress.org. And I created this with cafe/restaurants in mind. And a lot of the patterns here on the front page, including the header pattern here, is sort of geared towards that audience. We have a little color spot on the on the top, we have the social icons, we have opening hours, and a small menu. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And everything on this page is thumbed completely within the site editor. So opening hours, again, here, we have one of the cafe/restaurant-oriented Block Patterns that are included in the thing with information for location and our cafe restaurant chain. We have some testimonials, a call to action for when you want to make a reservation, somewhere nice looking coffee, cafe menu, a different call to action. A very tasty looking lemon cake, I think. And then some more information about the theme itself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And my plan for making this theme is that I was going to keep it as simple as possible within the constraints on Full-Site Editing, and block themes with just something I struggled with. Because I want to basically tweak and adjust everything. So when it&#8217;s something in the like core Block Editor styles that I don&#8217;t really agree with I to try to override them, which never works out well because then they need to keep up to date with the latest Gutenberg updates and so on. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>With Full-Site Editing, what&#8217;s going to happen is as the Block Editor gets better and better with every Gutenberg update, and every WordPress release is that theme developers will actually remove CSS from their themes step by step. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the whole idea with dropping Sr. eventually there will only need to be the theme of JSON file, which Ellen will show in our demo. Where everything that makes the theme a theme, all the colors, all the fonts, all of the layout adjustments will only have within a single JSON file which can be easily changed and adapted for other themes and so on. So hopefully CSS will be something that you can have the doesn&#8217;t need to add to make your theme look good. So I look forward to removing a lot more CSS in the future in future updates. And here you can see a brief overview of the structure of what files are included. So we want to get this where this file is the only file in the theme folder. So one day, hopefully, maybe a screenshot as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second big component of the Theme is really all of the Block Patterns which are bundled with it as well, which are all listed out on this page. And this is really the second big puzzle piece I would say on block-based things it needs to look good and and include a few examples of how to combine the different blocks in patterns that make the styles look and work as well as possible. So that&#8217;s a very brief look at the WordPress theme. Alright, I think that&#8217;s all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Carolina Nymark:</strong> I can say on this that what I like most about this theme is not that this block team, but it&#8217;s so cute, just really makes you happy to look at it. Really, really cute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anders Noren:</strong> I&#8217;m really, really happy to do her that. No, thank you. I have some. I mean, since the themes, the block-based themes themselves are so simple to actually make. You need to spend that time that you would otherwise spend writing a bunch of PHP on something else. So I just made illustrations for two which was a lot of fun. I mean, maybe I got a bit carried away with it as well. All right. Oh, I think your audio is muted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </strong>Yep, I muted it because I entered a few comments on YouTube. And there was Marcus Kazmirczak and I need to ask him if I&#8217;m butchering his name now he says &#8220;I&#8217;m an Anders super fan. I&#8217;ve been running themes for years. So and then he loves the bright colors and the feel Yeah. And Gangoff says I did recommend the theme done who wants to learn block themes and the theme is really good looking. So these are comments and love saying thanks Carolina and Anders for the block themes and she has a question about we&#8217;re gonna go through the question just in a bit. Ellen, are you ready?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ellen Bauer:</strong> I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I share my screen I have to select them so um, I thought that it&#8217;s a little bit improvised because and showed kind of the front end of the themes it&#8217;s probably fun to look at at the back end so just kind of to give an overview for anyone who hasn&#8217;t looked at what we are building so this is our I know website it&#8217;s like the presentation website for our for our project, and I just opened the different pages so you kind of see what we&#8217;re building like the layout wise. So the different pages we kind of present the work that way and what our approach is with this site is that anything we put out here that&#8217;s just the block and post is always the latest version of our I know work so everything you see here you can build with our patterns and with everything we have like out in the beam and with our blocks. So I thought it&#8217;s fun like we don&#8217;t have any showcase website and stuff yet up we will add that because that&#8217;s gonna be fun. See, but you can see like what we are building you can build so I think that&#8217;s an awesome approach. So we had I know as like classic theme with just patterns in the beginning and then we converted it to block theme. So I don&#8217;t know, not everyone has started using block themes. So what happens if you use block theme instead of instead of a classic theme, you see the site editor, which is currently in beta. And actually, at the very beginning, I kind of didn&#8217;t know that is the customizer was kind of fun like for us they have it anymore. So you kind of need to work around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> You were breaking up in a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ellen Bauer:</strong> What do and what we have? Actually? Am I frozen? Yeah, a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Okay. Oh, no. No, we got to know the screen changed</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ellen Bauer:</strong> My screen or the audio?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> The audio was going on the screen finally changed to the experimental settings. And I think with the latest plugin on the site, actually. Oh, you can&#8217;t hear me. Yeah, I hear you. Okay, yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead. I&#8217;m sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen Bauer: Okay. it&#8217;s my internet connection. Oh, my God. Oh. Well, the site editor is?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah, I think the internet connection in conjunction with the video going back and forth. Might be a problem. So let&#8217;s no audio at all. Um, Ellen, can you hear me?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen Bauer: I can hear you. I it&#8217;s my internet connection is unstable. Should we maybe talk and then I can do the presentation and a bit later?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah, let&#8217;s do that. And we have our first. So what you wanted to show was how the site editor works with your theme. And yes. And I think there&#8217;s too much power that needs to go out of in and out on the visuals for your internet connection. So. So if you want to try things for those who don&#8217;t know it? And yes, that&#8217;s a theme JSON file with the template parts. And so the end headers and header logo header dark for the stork and for the live columns, like these all sections on the same. So do you want to stop sharing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen Bauer: Should I try again? Oh, should I stop?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: I would say stop sharing. Okay, because that you can we can try later. Yeah. Either later or kind of put it in a we saw your theme. Yeah, you&#8217;ve scrolled very well through it. So I really like it. And there were also some comments there. I love your design said Lobsang wangdue and then we had no audio on Wi Fi problems. Check. Yeah, it&#8217;s the internet. Yeah. When Facebook went offline for six hours. Yeah. So it&#8217;s still a little fragile. So Badlob Song had a question for how to inherit theme JSON to child theme, JSON at the moment, that doesn&#8217;t seem to work. Do you have an answer for that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carolina Nymark: I do have yours. Maybe because it should work since the latest version 11.6 from last week, it should actually work. Oh, yeah, I haven&#8217;t updated Gutenberg. I suggest that you try again with the Shan theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen Bauer: I actually tried that out too. Am I can you hear me here? You know, I think I&#8217;m totally off</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: No. Yeah, it was just a combination. Good New Zealand. video that kind of made you</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen Bauer: Yeah, I don&#8217;t. I tried that too, with the child theme and it didn&#8217;t work like just two or three weeks ago, because we actually really want to get into child themes. And there was an update. Yeah, like Carolina said, it should work a lot better now. And I think it will be worked on quite a bit like over the next two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Okay, so um, so that was the first question. And that seems to be the only question right now from the audience. So I have a question. So when you were trying to what were the concepts, going from classic to block-based theme that you had a hard time kind of connecting. You mentioned, Ellen, the HTML part of that was, what were other things that were that are totally different, but that kind of a little bit of a hurdle to get it all right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen Bauer: From our side, it was mainly like, not the like, not the actual development, because the file template structure and stuff kind of stays the same. So you just kind of need to, you can actually go into the editor, and then switch to code mode and kind of copy paste your work. And luckily, like under said, we could look like we also looked at Carolina’s theme. And especially also the block based theme from, like Automattic is building. And that quadrat theme that really helped me just to get a first idea of what I&#8217;m actually doing. It was mostly like after we can watch it to that, like with updates, I didn&#8217;t quite understand completely understand the structure that, like once you edit anything in your template, that it becomes like a custom template. And so a theme author updates their work, the templates, it doesn&#8217;t get updated for every user automatically. That was kind of the confusing part. I because normally, as a theme author, you had complete control like of your template files, and because more things like users can customize themselves and adapt in the template files. And they use they kind of customize it. So you need to be more careful with update, like what you update or what you shouldn&#8217;t update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Paui-Haack: Do you think that&#8217;s a bug?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen Bauer: That No, no, no, I think it just it was like just I didn&#8217;t quite get it. Like think the concept you kind of really have to play around with to get the concept because it&#8217;s so different. And like Anders said, like, he thinks he will kind of get rid of his CSS work. And which I think is cool. We I think that definitely true that like global styles will be there. And but I think it&#8217;s also awesome that there will be different approaches, like we will kind of have a base CSS and then work with different things to solve that. So you can use child themes for that, which is awesome. So that totally different kind of approaches going forward, which is cool. It will be cool to see like people building totally different things. And I think the global styles was pretty easy to get into the theme. json. And then also I think we need to mention that it&#8217;s the first version of the theme JSON. And it&#8217;s kind of like chaos Kartik and gets like long pretty quickly. And that will definitely change. So we have to be on our like, be on our watch to see what how the theme JSON approach will be improved, probably split up into multiple sections and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: So Anders, would you were there concepts that you found difficult to grasp? And that kind of took a while to actually figure it out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anders Noren: Yeah, I think one of the most challenging part for me was actually the design phase of making a theme. Because usually when you make a classic theme, you can design it pretty much however you want. And know that using PHP and CSS, you can recreate your design exactly, because you have full control over where all elements are, what elements are used and how you style those elements. But with the with block-based themes to really govern by what can be created in the site editor, so how users can combine the different blocks to create the layout and how you can combine different blocks to create the layout. So my initial designs for to the were pretty involved in like the header and footer areas. And I was really happy with the design and then they said about recreating those layouts in the site editor. I quickly realized that I couldn&#8217;t create them as I have designed them because The Block Editor is still somewhat limited in how you can layout the page and added scale correctly down to mobile and stuff. So thing, the approach for the signing block-based themes will rely a lot more on you actually deciding what colors you will use, what fonts you will use, and then the sign how specific blocks and block styles will look. And after you have all of those components, and basically your global styles set, you will need to go about actually building the design with the different header layouts and footer layouts in the site editor itself. And I think that would be a pretty big workflow change really, for everyone builds classic themes now and we&#8217;ll move over to block-based themes. Because I believe a lot of designers will have my experience of designing something really involved trying to build it realizing I can&#8217;t build it like this, and then basically re-evaluating the original design and try to work within the constraints of the site editor. And what you can do, as the Block Editor gets better and better. I think that was really my The biggest change I had to go through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Understand that. So it&#8217;s more like you need, you need to know the end product, before you actually have the product. And also, there is probably the design system approach for the patterns can have that will come into much higher attention there. So we got some questions, and one is from Tim Bowen. And the theme JSON color naming. And that&#8217;s of course, one that will occupy plenty of so is there a primary, secondary, tertiary kind of naming? Or would you rather do the blue and the green at the red kind of thing? I think it would also goes into that question also goes into the theme switching problem, or changing colors later on. To get this done? Do you want to take that wants to take Carolina?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carolina Nymark: I switched from using slugs. slug is the code the name and the name that is visible is a different can be different, right? So I switched from using red blue to primary secondary trader because there were a lot of discussions around it. How do we make Block Patterns match when we switch themes? And then how do we make colors match when we use Block Patterns from the Block Patterns directory and so on. So you can this be red, the color can be red, but actually naming the code can be primary or secondary. That should reduce some of the problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: That was also your approach. Anders I think when I looked at things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anders Noren: Yeah, exactly. And that was actually the as I&#8217;m sure everyone here knows Twenty Twenty Two. The next default theme was unveiled just the other day, and looks really, really good. I think and the first thing I checked when the GitHub repository for that went live was how the naming scheme for the colors are in that theme. And they also use the primary secondary tertiary model. So I&#8217;m assuming that a lot of people will use Twenty Twenty Two as a foundation for future block-based themes. We should say that, I think the original proponent of using that structure, one of the foremost proponents at least was recover as well in a blog post. He sort of got the ball rolling on this discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen Bauer: A tiny bit because when I got into it, what is actually pretty cool is that you have your general color palette for the theme. And then you can also add specific color palettes because I was got kind of like long, I thought maybe not so helpful. And so you can actually name color palettes just for specific blocks, which I think is super helpful. So you have a button block and you only want your button colors in the button block. So you have like, and like block specific color palettes as well in options in the theme JSON which I think is helpful to kind of split it up and make it more approachable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: So another question is can I use theme JSON with a classic theme? I am using Genesis and that comes from Lapsang Wangdue. Again, and I can answer that quite fast because Marcus because music has on his blog exactly that using theme JSON on classic theme, and I will share the link in the chat window. So you can read up about it, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s actually quite nice. Have any of you use the theme JSON for classic themes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anders Noren: I haven&#8217;t tried it yet. Actually. Yeah, I want to look into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah, what I really like is that in the classic theme, up until that point, you had to use the color or assign the color in your functions, PHP for the palette. And then in your CSS, you had to actually have a section for the background color and a section for the text color. So you were talking about the three times. So but the theme JSON, what it does, you put it, what you put in the functions, PHP, kind of similar on theme JSON and that&#8217;s it, you don&#8217;t have to do any CSS. And that&#8217;s really helpful. So I really enjoyed that when I was reading through that then trying that out. So Jonah Sander has a question. So I know includes some PHP files, but not Tov, but which is Anders’ theme, where will the journey go with or without PHP files?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen Bauer: So obviously, the function PHP will stay. I think like, but it&#8217;s just it&#8217;s like super stripped down. Yeah, you can replace a lot of things from the functions into the into the theme JSON file. Sorry. But why we have still PHP files, it&#8217;s mainly because of our WooCommerce support. We needed to keep some things in for further WooCommerce support, because some of the things are not quite yet ready. That was the only reason so we kind of like a little bit. It&#8217;s still in between theme. But I think Yeah, with without PHP files for, for us, at least. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: You did a little introduction to your toll theme. And you made a comment about that. Your classic theme, Excel was so elaborate and had so many thousands of lines of code and CSS lines, and it was so much lightweight, so much more lightweight to do a block-based by theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anders Noren: Yeah, yeah, there&#8217;s really no comparison in terms of your scale, or the themes. That was another thing I noticed on the Twenty Twenty Two github repository as well. You can see the GitHub stats for what type of files are included in the folder. And it&#8217;s just like, I think it&#8217;s maybe 6%, PHP, or something, and maybe 24%, JSON, and then just HTML. Because the HTML is obviously the templates and the template bots. The tool has a lot more styles right now, which I want to get down on as I can move more into the node JSON. But even with the style, the size, sort of style sheets, the comparing it to a theme like Excel, which has like seven PHP classes, like 2000 lines and functions for PHP. It&#8217;s just completely different scalable theme. And I mean, obviously, with a block-based theme, the potential for what you can do in the theme is so much greater than that classic theme. So I&#8217;ll be really interested to see how many people actually get into creating themes. Now the block-based themes become much more easy to create. Because I think a lot of people don&#8217;t have a background in development, but rather in the sign will have themes.JSON. That&#8217;s a very nice entry point to start with colors and typography, and then getting integrating patterns and so on. So if we really open up the entire theme creation process, to people with less of a technical background, and hopefully that in turn can lead to more interesting theme design. So we&#8217;re all which is something I know everyone who does this had been asking for, for years. So I really think the colors and typography will become king. In the theme development space so that&#8217;ll be really exciting, I think. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Totally if you want to say something regarding the weight of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carolina Nymark: Yes, right now we need to use PHP to register Block Patterns, but for example the the block styles, we can do them with JavaScript if you prefer. So there will be some PHP left, but I&#8217;m looking forward to plugins catching up, so that they don&#8217;t need to have some fallbacks. Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Okay, so the next question was, can you sign also from Lobsang Can you assign header and footer template ports to different pages and posts. She couldn&#8217;t find it from the dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carolina Nymark: You can assign them but you have to open that page or post first. So there is no dashboard you have to go to the site editor. And then either replace your current header if there is a header or add a new part. Okay. You have ideas for how you would like to assign them, please do share them because this is something that&#8217;s very interesting for Gutenberg development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah, that is actually quite a good point. Yeah, this has all not been it&#8217;s not all yet in WordPress, so there&#8217;s always a chance to have different approaches or fixes after the initial rollout and 5.9 then for the next version, so it&#8217;s good to try out the plugin Gutenberg plugin on on a test site and enable a block-based theme and then play around with it. So Plum Mood has a question for Ellen please share your experience in developing WooCommerce websites what is possible and what are the restrictions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen Bauer: So there are like it&#8217;s not ready for production yet. But I think as you just said, the good it&#8217;s super important for our for us right now to just look into it and try to make the best of it and what they&#8217;re building with whoo is they&#8217;re building woo blocks which is an extra plugin you can install at the moment so that is super helpful for anyone who has like worked with WooCommerce for a while the experience in the checkout and cart templates were not like it wasn&#8217;t really customizable a lot. So that will change tremendously because they&#8217;re also building everything in WooCommerce with blocks so at the moment you can install the woo blocks plugin and see how far they&#8217;re going and that they actually documenting it quite nicely and they asked some questions and they answered right away they have like a roadmap going but it&#8217;s a little bit behind compared to like just themes at the moment so we need to wait a little bit for them to to get it going. But yeah, we actually got WooCommerce into our theme and they I think variable pose like products are not working at the moment but it&#8217;s kind of working like it&#8217;s I wouldn&#8217;t like put it up for production sites but it&#8217;s cool to kind of go along with the development and it was module better than I thought it would be and I got into the the blocks already which is super helpful to get like a head start of what what is going on in WooCommerce if you&#8217;re developing for it so I think that was helpful and whatever wanted to mention like with the themes like where it&#8217;s going it&#8217;s so cool at the moment so I think as you said Birgit, there are so many different approaches and kind of like make your own thing out of it which we like we just fall out like teams were so established like plugin established now it&#8217;s like an open field where we can kind of our way into and I think that&#8217;s gonna be so cool to see.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Right? Yeah, you keep….</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen Bauer: Oh, I had what is happening with my internet Connect, Okay, I&#8217;m gonna shut maybe, maybe someone else would take over sorry, that&#8217;s so frustrating not only our connection is quite fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: So Carolina shared in the chat window a link to WooCommerce roadmap in connection with blocks and Site Health. And Derek is a publisher. And he says, Okay, this is what we&#8217;re doing now, and why we are not yet ready for blocks. And this is what soon to come. And yeah, in flip chart block as well as for the checkout block. And that was the reason why they&#8217;re so behind with a few things, because some of the features that they need are some of the hooks that they need. They haven&#8217;t been in the Block Editor yet. So they block, the Gutenberg team cannot need to catch up on things, especially with the connection with the REST API. So we have another question from Tim Bowen. Thank you. What are the current best practices for theme JSON, and responsive font sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anders Noren: So when it comes to best practices, and this ties in into what Elon was saying, as well, the interesting thing is that best practices hadn&#8217;t really been established for a lot of stuff around block-based themes. And I think that&#8217;s sort of what people will look to Twenty Twenty Two for, for a lot of those best practice discussions to happen around the next default theme, the first block-based default theme, and have those best practices be established as part of that development. But there are, of course, a lot of different approaches to everything. Basically, indoor play seems right now, which is very exciting, very fun. It feels like it&#8217;s been a long while since people basically wrote think thesis on their blogs about the best way to do stuff and WordPress development. And we&#8217;re really seeing a resurgence of that just in the last couple of weeks, are people arguing for the different approaches. I think, I think the current Twenty Twenty Two font sizes, use this CSS protocol, message method or function called clan, to set a base font size, and then use the viewport based on size for smaller screens, to scale it down from that original font size. And I know a couple of different themes that you start as well. So maybe that would be the current answer. But it could change. Keep a lookout on the Twenty Twenty Two GitHub issues, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah, it&#8217;s so I still come across a lot of websites where the font size is so large, that I barely can scroll fast enough to with my reading speed. So it&#8217;s gonna be really one of the things that I love designers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen Bauer: I think just I think that it&#8217;s it&#8217;s true like under said, I think the clamp approach will be taking over. And we are also like in the works to convert our, like, kind of responsive heck in our current team, like and I know like base to clam because it&#8217;s just the smartest approach. And it&#8217;s like, we can use it now in the like most browsers I think. And Rich actually posted a blog post yesterday. Rich Tabor on his blog about it. So maybe we can link that in the woods styles. He posted about fluid typography. Oh, right, right. Yeah. Like you said, like people start sharing again. What? Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of fun. Yeah. Facebook being out and stuff. We can all blog again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: We could blog before that. Yeah, you&#8217;re right. Oh, I got a copy link right down there. Just bring it into the chat window. And we have another question. From Jack Cannot surprise to hear and see different options to the admin panel. What do you think? The admin panel will look like in the future with blocks? Anybody wants to pick it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carolina Nymark: I&#8217;m not sure which admin panel if you want to expand on that, Jack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Jack, do you mean the site editor or the WP admin? Just answer so I can see that plugin developers could use Gutenberg components in the Login in the WP admin and I know there&#8217;s also those core CSS team is also working on streamlining the color selections on an admin, because they found that in the CSS they had they had about, I don&#8217;t know, 500 different colors. And when you want to change your color palette, then it&#8217;s really hard to actually adjust all the 500 lines of code or colors there. So the site editor is actually will mimic what the front end has and styles. So and that gets better and better. As far as I know, what was your experience with that Anders or Ellen or Carolina to get the side editor kind of match what&#8217;s on the front end? So the user has a really what you see is what you get to experience?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anders Noren: Yeah, I definitely think it&#8217;s getting a lot better. I think if you stick to only using theme.JSON right now, it basically will look the same. Because they are they are very good. The Gutenberg team about mapping those values to both views, I think the more difficult part is when you have a lot of custom CSS, like Google still has that knowing what elements to target and having those elements be targeted, consistently, both in the site editor and on the front term is very difficult, especially since the borrower through all the Gutenberg styles can differ quite a bit between the two views. So I think that&#8217;s another area where the sooner we can start to move more stuff into themes.JSON, the easier it will be. Because one of the common problems even with the blog, comm block-based Content Editor is that the priority of CSS and the names of elements change from update to update. So supporting those changes, could be quite a hurdle for themes that rolled a lot of custom CSS. And I think that&#8217;s what I look forward to with moving more stuff into theme.JSON. On that I can&#8217;t be less terrified of new updates. Fedora style center core element Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah, yeah, I can see that there have. Have any of you watched Helen Hou-Sandi’s presentation on the White House site at the WordCamp US?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anders Noren: I missed it, unfortunately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah. So I, she also talked a little bit about it, because they have this whole header, full width header image, and then a box that kind of is on the left side on the right side, on the header, with some links to go deeper into whatever the topic of the day is right now. And she said it was a little bit harder to match up the front end with the back end, because the side bar of the Block Editor has to get into the way. Yeah, it&#8217;s not going to be full screen. And so she said, a good remedy for that would be if you have custom blocks, that you put most of the most important things that people will use all the time into the block toolbar rather than into the sidebar. And so that&#8217;s kind of a remedy for that as well, just to kind of organize your real estate there. So Jack came back and said, Carolina, you mentioned something about no pages, maybe I misunderstood. So he had the question that about what you think the admin panel will look like in the future with blocks. And then he might have misunderstood and Ellen, you showed that you didn&#8217;t have a custom tab. But I think what you might be referring to Jack is that Ellen said she doesn&#8217;t have a customizer that some of the settings will all be in the global styles sidebar, right? Yeah. And that&#8217;s definitely to come here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen Bauer: Yeah, so the customizer disappears with the site editor with the, I think probably in 5.9. I don&#8217;t know I think Carolina you probably know more about that. So I&#8217;m actually not missing the customizer at all, so we&#8217;re fine. So we end but we always used it pretty minimal, but there are different themes out there that kind of used it heavily. And yeah, we just had to kind of rewrite a lot and I will write a blog post about that, like, how we manage without the customizer, because that&#8217;s super interesting. And yeah. We don&#8217;t have any.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: You said at all. No, we all expecting that blog post stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen Bauer: Yeah, I will do that I will do it definitely. Because I just like all the transition, I thought, Oh, I have to share that, because it just makes sense to share now, like, since it&#8217;s all still in progress, and it&#8217;s more like snippets that we&#8217;ve learned along the way. And yeah, you managed better without the customizer set than you would expect. But I think yeah, just get into like, new approaches now. And I think in general, just the like, the theme JSON will replace everything that we had in the customizer for, for themes. And it will be more, I think, I think beam can be more like viewed as just like a skin, like you have skins and in the code editors and stuff. So it&#8217;s just the skin, you lay over things. And then you come in with blocks, and you come in with patterns. And you have all these, like more modular kind of ways to to add things to WordPress. And I think that&#8217;s just the smart approach, and will be a lot more user friendly. In the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Sorry, Carolina, I wanted to say something about customizer. And well, Ellen thought you might say something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carolina Nymark: I do not have any more information on what might or might not be in 5.9. The customizer is not being removed. But if you activate a team that has support for Full Site Editing, the menu option will not be there. Yeah, but it will stop the global styles. So for all the teams, or for new, what we call classic team to customize this will still be there until the team developer has come over this initial period, the transition as soon as they learn that it&#8217;s so much easier to work in a theme JSON than creating custom customizer options. Yeah, then the theme.JSON will take over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah, but I think that it&#8217;s not gonna the customizer will not disappear from WordPress in the next three years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carolina Nymark: Is not supported, right? And no one is going to remove the code or defines for the customizer, it&#8217;s actually only the menu option. That is no longer there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Right? And you approach it with slash customizer PHP. Yes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carolina Nymark: There is on the ad teams page, you have the live preview. But you can still actually view a block-based team in the customizer, so it&#8217;s not gone. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen Bauer: And also WooCommerce at the moment you use it uses it still like even with block themes, because someone asked about like WooCommerce support, they still needed. So if you have WooCommerce active with a black theme now you can still access things now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: I think we have one last question, because we are on on the hour mark here. And so that was Timbo and again, will theme.JSON always be adding so many important references in the CSS. So I think the talks about the color palette and coming into that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carolina Nymark: Until you come up with a smarter solution. Unfortunately, I mean, it is it is something that no one wants. But this is where we have ended up with because no one has been able to do it smarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anders Noren: Yeah, I think I prefer the importance to the same class name five times in a row to increase the priority of the targeting, which has also become pretty frequent. But I totally understand that it&#8217;s a difficult problem to solve for the people who actually need to write the CSS as part of Gutenberg and core because there are so many different themes and so much different CSS to account for. So they really need to bump up that priority to a very high level to make it work. But it is a bit of an eyesore, but it&#8217;s unfortunately, necessary, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: And I think that the team is very hard exploring also creating the theme JSON not in code view but to create an interface so that way you can you can then we put all the things in and then it automatically creates a theme JSON file so maybe that&#8217;s not connected to that topic completely but there&#8217;s also something people that are more comfortable with CSS have a hard time thinking Oh Do I have to write my CSS now in theme Jason I don&#8217;t like it kind of thing. So there will be a remedy for that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Lobsang has a question Carolina I was thinking about you can sign template parts like main template page or post from the dashboard. What your I think that&#8217;s out of context, in certain things i o that you can assign the index.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carolina Nymark: I almost need an image of what&#8217;s what you&#8217;re thinking about to baby 10 standard, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: And Brian says, I have to leave this for another call. But I thoroughly enjoyed the discussion. And Tim, is 19 so thank you all so yes, it seems like we all that&#8217;s all the time we have today and we I have just two more questions for our panelists. So do you have an announcement or something that you couldn&#8217;t get in before and you want to have people in mind and how can they reach you if they wanted to get in touch with you?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen Bauer: An announcement is just sorry for the failed presentation that was maybe I can do a little I can do a little video or something like as a replacement I can share on Twitter that is a little bit sad from my side I&#8217;m sorry about that and yet just like us on twitter on our blog like comment yeah we kind of everywhere around our event even like on on the in the support forum for our blog and theme and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anders Noren: Yeah, you can follow me on Twitter. I guess. It&#8217;s mostly WordPress related stuff these days. But I&#8217;m under Ashmolean at Twitter, one word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carolina Nymark: No announcements, but I have enjoyed this shot. And I can be reached on the wordpresser slack. And my name is Brianna, or on Twitter at Carolina Cuyama. So one name one word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Well, a big thank you to you all, and to our viewers for the great questions. And I also have a survey for you. So I&#8217;m gonna share that in the chat. If you want to fill that out, we are always trying to improve our shows and with your opinions. That will be great. And if you have any more questions, you can always send them to pauli@Gutenberg times.com that&#8217;s pauli@ Gutenbergtimes.com. A recording will be available in a few minutes on the YouTube channel. And we will publish the transcript and the resources. Also for the resources of the theme.JSON. You will think looking for a website. I think the earlier post to Marcus Kazmierczack you can use the theme JSON also for classic theme. I think he had a quite a few resources in his blog post as well. Yeah, thank you to Carolina, Ellen and Anders for spending time with us. It was a great joy talking to you. Be well and good bye and good luck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carolina Nymark: Good luck. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen Bauer: Bye. Thank you. Bye. Have a good evening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Yes, and that&#8217;s that&#8217;s it, you Take care and I&#8217;ll see you in the slack.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 20:12:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Birgit Pauli-Haack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: OptinMonster 2.6.5 Patches Multiple Security Vulnerabilities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=124913\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:185:\"https://wptavern.com/optinmonster-2-6-5-patches-multiple-security-vulnerabilities?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=optinmonster-2-6-5-patches-multiple-security-vulnerabilities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2305:\"<p>In late September, Chloe Chamberland, a researcher at Wordfence, discovered <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2021/10/1000000-sites-affected-by-optinmonster-vulnerabilities/\">multiple security vulnerabilities</a> in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/optinmonster/\">OptinMonster</a> plugin, which could allow unauthenticated attackers to export sensitive information and inject malicious JavaScript into vulnerable sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The OptinMonster team promptly patched the plugin and updated the plugin again after more feedback from the Wordfence team. Version 2.6.5 was released on October 7, 2021, to address these issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OptinMonster is used on more than 1 million WordPress sites to create popup campaigns, email subscription forms, sticky announcement bars, and gamified spin-a-wheel opt-in forms. The plugin relies heavily on the use of WP REST API endpoints. Chamberland identified the majority of these endpoints as &ldquo;insecurely implemented:&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The most critical of the REST-API endpoints was the&nbsp;<code>/wp-json/omapp/v1/support</code>&nbsp;endpoint, which disclosed sensitive data like the site&rsquo;s full path on the server, along with the API key needed to make requests on the OptinMonster site. With access to the API key, an attacker could make changes to any campaign associated with a site&rsquo;s connected OptinMonster account and add malicious JavaScript that would execute anytime a campaign was displayed on the exploited site.</p><p>Worse yet, an attacker did not need to be authenticated to the site in order to access the API endpoint</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Chamberland described how any unauthenticated attacker could add malicious JavaScript to vulnerable OptinMonster sites and redirect visitors to external malicious domains, or create the opportunity for site takeover using JavaScript to inject new admin user accounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a precaution, OptinMonster has invalidated all API keys, forcing administrators to generate new ones, in case any keys had been previously compromised. There are no sites known to have been exploited at this time, but the vulnerabilities are now public.

However, it hit a bump in the road toward its destination, the WordPress plugin directory. A mix-up with getting the release tagged was the culprit, so it sat in limbo for around eight hours. Technically, it was available via its GitHub and SVN repositories. However, the version shown on WordPress.org was stuck on 11.7.1 for much of the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest release includes dozens of enhancements across the block library, theming, global styles, and more. As we inch closer to the December release of WordPress 5.9, some features are just making it under the wire of the looming feature-freeze deadline, which is set for November 9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spacing-related controls are still working their way through the block library. The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35772\">Heading, Post Title, Query Title</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35374\">Social Icons</a> blocks support custom margins. <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35775\">Post Featured Image</a> gets both margin and padding controls, and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34546\">buttons now have a block gap</a> (spacing) option alongside a margin setting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block child themes can now overrule parent theme values via <code>theme.json</code>. I <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/designing-block-based-wordpress-child-themes-with-a-single-json-file\">covered this feature</a> in more detail earlier this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block themes now automatically opt into several theme-supported features, including featured images, feed links, and more. Developers should <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35593\">check the pull request</a> for things they may no longer need to register.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"cover-block-background-opacity\">Cover Block Background Opacity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Since the initial Cover block launched, users have always been able to change the opacity of the background image. However, when using a background color or gradient, the option to do so would disappear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the release of Gutenberg 11.8, users can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35065\">change the transparency regardless of the background</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a feature that was particularly important to me. I <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/32339\">opened a ticket</a> to address this in May of this year. My primary use case was to create the effect shown in the following screenshot:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Layered transparent Cover blocks.\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, I am using two Cover blocks here. The outer instance uses a background image. However, the inner one uses a transparent gradient so that the image bleeds through. There are some workarounds I could have employed to make this happen as a developer. However, I wanted end-users to have the ability to build cool things too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because this was one of my wish list items, I want to thank Glen Davies for putting in the bulk of the work. However, many others provided feedback and performed code reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><s>There is a bug with the feature. When a user selects a theme-defined gradient background, it is added to both the outer and inner HTML elements. The transparency is correctly applied to the inner container. However, it appears to not work because the outside wrapper background is opaque.</s> <strong>Update:</strong> this issue was from a code conflict.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"automatically-generated-heading-anchors\">Automatically-Generated Heading Anchors</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />List view of Heading block anchors.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Gutenberg 11.8 now automatically generates and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/30825\">adds anchors for all Heading blocks</a> inserted into the editor. These anchors appear in the block options sidebar under the &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; tab and the list view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this feature is welcome as it is, it may serve as merely a stepping stone toward something many have been waiting on: a Table of Contents block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically, the ToC block was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-gutenberg-wordpress-plugin-to-introduce-a-table-of-contents-block\">merged in February this year</a>, and it is still bundled within the Gutenberg plugin. However, it is hidden from usage at the moment. It needed time to mature and a way to add anchors to headings without manual input.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this piece of the puzzle in place, a ToC block is much closer to reality. Maybe even by the time WordPress 6.0 lands next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"featured-patterns\">Featured Patterns</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting a featured pattern.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The first block patterns to appear in the inserter now come from a curated <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35115\">featured list</a>.  It is currently limited to 15 patterns and is pulled from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/categories/featured/\">featured category on WordPress.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are currently picked by team members working on the pattern directory.  It is unclear if there will be a more formal and detailed process for this list in the future.  Because pattern submissions are still not open to the public, there are a limited number of options to choose from.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"plain-blockquote-style\">&ldquo;Plain&rdquo; Blockquote Style</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Plain blockquote style.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">One of my biggest pet peeves is core adding custom block styles, and this extra one for the Quote block is no different. It is simply called &ldquo;Plain.&rdquo; This is in addition to Default and Large.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/29856\">style removes any borders</a> for the quote, assuming the user&rsquo;s active theme displayed any. Because my theme&rsquo;s default blockquote output did not, the block style does nothing. I suppose I can always unregister it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If anything, I want us to backtrack this new Plain style and remove the existing Large one (relegating it to typography controls). Leave the custom stuff to theme authors. In the future, we should think long and hard before registering custom styles from Gutenberg or core WordPress.  Otherwise, we are creating legacy baggage that will land on the backs of theme authors to carry.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"pinterest-oembed-support\">Pinterest oEmbed Support</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Embedding a Pinterest pin.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Honestly, I can hardly believe that WordPress did not already support Pinterest embeds. The well-established service is over a decade old and highly popular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg contributors quickly added a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34895\">Pinterest variation</a> for the embed block following a recent <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/53448\">core patch</a> that approved support.

It states that internal Google communications identified header bidding as an &ldquo;existential threat.&rdquo; The complaint alleges that Google throttled non-AMP ads in order to give AMP a &ldquo;nice comparative boost:&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>After crippling AMP&rsquo;s compatibility with header bidding, Google went to market falsely telling publishers that adopting AMP would enhance page load times. But Google employees knew that AMP only improves the &ldquo;median of performance&rdquo; and AMP pages can actually load slower than other publisher speed optimization techniques. In other words, the ostensible benefits of faster load times for a Google-cached AMP version of a webpage were not true for publishers that designed their web pages for speed. Some publishers did not adopt AMP because they knew their pages actually loaded faster than AMP pages.</p><p>The speed benefits Google marketed were also at least partly a result of Google&rsquo;s throttling. <strong>Google throttles the load time of non-AMP ads by giving them artificial one-second delays in order to give Google AMP a &ldquo;nice comparative boost.&rdquo;</strong> Throttling non-AMP ads slows down header bidding, which Google then uses to denigrate header bidding for being too slow. &ldquo;Header Bidding can often increase latency of web pages and create security flaws when executed incorrectly,&rdquo; Google falsely claimed. Internally, Google employees grappled with &ldquo;how to [publicly] justify [Google] making something slower.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The unredacted filing&nbsp;also states that internal documents show that AMP pages brought 40% less revenue to publishers:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Google gave publishers a Faustian bargain: (1) publishers who used header bidding would see the traffic to their site drop precipitously from Google suppressing their ranking in search and re-directing traffic to AMP-compatible publishers; or (2) publishers could adopt AMP pages to maintain traffic flow but forgo exchange competition in header bidding, which would make them more money on an impression-by-impression basis. Either option was far inferior to the options available to publishers before Google introduced AMP. Just how inferior? <strong>According to Google&rsquo;s internal documents, 40 percent less revenue on AMP pages.</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The complaint succinctly summarizes the reason many publishers felt under the gun to allocate developer resources for AMPing up their websites, and why Google was in the position to force the issue despite widespread criticism of the AMP project. It also describes how Google&rsquo;s anticompetitive tactics and control of the market essentially has small publishers over a barrel:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Direct evidence confirms Google&rsquo;s monopoly power in the display ad network market. GDN charges high double-digit commissions of at least 32 percent on advertising transactions, which, according to public sources, is double the &ldquo;standard rate&rdquo; elsewhere in the industry. Internally, Google acknowledges that its fees are very high and that it can demand them because of its market power. For example, in an internal 2016 conversation, Google executives commented that Google&rsquo;s ad networks make &ldquo;A LOT of money&rdquo; with its commission, and they acknowledged that they do this because, quite simply, &ldquo;we can.&rdquo; <strong>&ldquo;Smaller pubs don&rsquo;t have alternative revenue sources,&rdquo;</strong> explained one Google employee when addressing the lack of viable competing ad networks available to its customers.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The suit, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and nine other state attorneys general, also exposes a number of code-named programs. Project NERA is the most insidious among these and one that publishers should know about:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Project NERA was Google&rsquo;s original plan to create a closed ecosystem out of the open internet. Google documents reveal that Google&rsquo;s motive was to &ldquo;successfully mimic a walled garden across the open web [so] we can protect our margins.&rdquo; For Google, Project NERA&rsquo;s walled garden meant two things: controlling the design of publishers&rsquo; ad space, then forcing those publishers to sell their ad space exclusively through Google&rsquo;s products. According to internal Google documents, this strategy would permit Google to extract even higher intermediation fees. A Google employee aptly described Google&rsquo;s ambition for Project NERA by acknowledging that Google wants to &ldquo;capture the benefits of tightly &lsquo;operating&rsquo; a property &hellip; without &lsquo;owning&rsquo; the property and facing the challenges of building new consumer products.&rdquo; Google&rsquo;s nickname for this walled garden plan was &ldquo;not-owned-but-operated,&rdquo; or &ldquo;NOBO&rdquo; for short.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The complaint also alleges that Facebook and Google colluded to manipulate header bidding auctions, among many other anticompetitive practices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google has not yet responded to the AMP-specific allegations but has <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/response-doj/\">published a response</a> to the Department of Justice, calling the complaint &ldquo;a deeply flawed lawsuit that would do nothing to help consumers.&rdquo; The post attempts to refute the DOJ&rsquo;s &ldquo;dubious complaint&rdquo; with demonstrations of how easy it is to change the default search engine on different devices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this year, Google&rsquo;s Director of Economic Policy, Adam Cohen, addressed the claims that AMP was designed to hurt header bidding, saying that it was created in partnership with publishers and other tech companies to help webpages load faster and improve the experience on mobile devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;AMP supports a range of monetization options, including&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://docs.prebid.org/formats/amp.html\" target=\"_blank\">header bidding</a>. Publishers are free to use both AMP and header bidding technologies together if they choose,&rdquo; Cohen said. &ldquo;The use of header bidding doesn&rsquo;t factor into publisher search rankings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AMP project has not officially responded to the allegations in the unredacted complaint. Google <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/amp-project-joins-openjs-foundation\">transferred the project&rsquo;s governance to the OpenJS Foundation</a> in 2019, a move which skeptics hailed as &ldquo;mostly meaningless window-dressing.&rdquo;&nbsp;In August 2021, ex-AMP Advisory Committee member Jeremy Keith gave a behind-the-scenes look at the project in his <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jeremy-keith-resigns-from-amp-advisory-committee-it-has-become-clear-to-me-that-amp-remains-a-google-product\">resignation announcement</a>. &ldquo;It has become clear to me that AMP remains a Google product, with only a subset of pieces that could even be considered open source,&rdquo; Keith said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the beginning, AMP was not a user-friendly product. It severely encumbered publishers and and was roundly denounced by advocates of the open web. In Google&rsquo;s zealous drive to get publishers to adopt AMP, the company began investing heavily in developing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/google/#content-plugins\">WordPress plugins</a>&nbsp;that would make make its products easier to use. More than 500,000 WordPress sites are now using the official&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/\">AMP plugin</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DOJ&rsquo;s complaint alleges that Google is exploiting the position of smaller publishers that do not have any other options for revenue. It identifies AMP as a vehicle for anticompetitive practices and exposes viperous initiatives like Project NERA that do not have publishers best interests in mind. Any project that would seek to build &ldquo;a walled garden across the open web&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t seem particularly complementary to democratizing publishing. Getting to the bottom of these concerns should be a priority for the WordPress community and should inspire more scrutiny over Google-led core projects. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 19:25:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WordCamp Central: WordCamp US Update: City Search 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/?p=3142268\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/news/2021/10/27/wordcamp-us-update-city-search-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3383:\"<p>You read that correctly, this post is about Call for Cities for WordCamp US 2022! There are some big changes to how we plan to approach city selection for 2022.</p>\n<p>In past years, local WordPress communities applied to be the host city of WordCamp US. Organizers were asked to gather info, such as enthusiasm for their city, local WordPress community activity, organizer interest, and even possible venue bids.</p>\n<p>This is a big ask: securing a holistic bid from a convention center for +2,000 people is not something most of us do!</p>\n<p>In 2020, the WCUS team hired an events management team to handle this step. Local WordPress communities still expressed why their city would be the best fit for WCUS, but the work of soliciting bids and securing a competitive quote was left to a professional. Great, right? Well, 2020 did not work out as hoped.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/kcristiano/\">@kcristiano</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/kdrewien/\">@kdrewien</a>, and I, as community deputies and past lead organizers of WordCamp US, began discussing the need to secure a venue to WordCamp US. We all felt that requesting applications from local WordPress communities today would place an undue burden on volunteers. Risk evaluation and forecasting feasibility of an in-person flagship requires a professional events management team.</p>\n<p>We intend to do a city search instead of a Call for Cities.</p>\n<p>The events management team will send out a Request for Proposal (RFP) and negotiate with venues, and then select the City and venue that best meets the needs for WordCamp US.</p>\n<p>The team is looking for a venue that can accommodate WCUS scaling up or down in size, and would allow us to cancel or postpone with minimal financial impact. There were local WordPress communities who applied to be host cities for 2020 and we are including those cities in this year&#8217;s search.</p>\n<p>You may be wondering what this organizing team for WordCamp US will look like! That’s an excellent question.</p>\n<p>WordCamp US 2022 will be opening Call for Organizers in mid-November, and a team of past WordCamp US organizers will review those applications. This team will include <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/kcristiano/\">@kcristiano</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/kdrewien/\">@kdrewien</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mysweetcate/\">@mysweetcate</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell/\">@aaroncampbell</a>, and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/kimwhite/\">@kimwhite</a>. The plan is to bring the organizing team to the future host city. Once the city is chosen, we will look to the local community for Organizers. If the Call for Organizers has ended before the city is announced we will reopen applications for Organizers from the host city.</p>\n<p>We hope to see you in-person at WordCamp US 2022!

I haven’t been through some extreme hardship, or dealt with a personal tragedy. In life, I have been significantly influenced by a negative voice inside me that tells me I’m an impostor and focuses on my past failures and things about myself I cannot change. In short, I don’t see myself as a hero. However, being a part of the WordPress community has taught me to not be too hard on myself and appreciate things I take for granted. This essay is a summary of the personal struggles I have had, mostly alone, in my head.</p>\n<p>My family teases me that I started learning to speak after I turned four. I think they exaggerate but it fits my personality. I am slow, it’s not a big impediment, but people point it out sometimes (<a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2019/12/27/ellen-mubwanda-killer-copywriting-tips-that-sell/\">Like at 13:25 on this WordCamp video</a>) . I am highly sensitive both emotionally and physically to things like bright lights, strong smells, heat and cold. I easily get overwhelmed under pressure or in emotionally or socially tasking activities. As a child, I was under a lot of pressure to be normal. To wake up! Speak up! Stop crying! I carried that pressure into adulthood and spent the first 30 years of my life trying to be ‘normal’. As much as I pushed myself to be more outgoing, work harder, be stronger I only ended up an exhausted, frustrated multiple time college dropout.</p>\n<h3>Finding WordPress</h3>\n<p>In 2016 I started learning WordPress with the goal of becoming a web developer. In October of that year, I found out there was a new WordPress meetup in Harare and signed up to attend straight away. Before my first meetup I expected to meet a bunch of condescending tech bros who I hoped would at least tolerate me. What I found there was the total opposite, a diverse group of people who wanted to learn and share their knowledge. What topped it off was when Thabo Tswana, who founded the meetup, ended with the invitation to host meetups. His message was anyone was welcome to host or attend a meetup, whether you were a beginner, professional, blogger, business owner, or developer, everyone is welcome. I was hooked! I signed up to speak at the first WordCamp Harare, and went on to become a meetup organizer, and even lead organizer of WordCamp Harare 2019!</p>\n<blockquote><p>Exposure to the global community taught me a new meaning of citizenship.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Not the kind of citizenship with arbitrary borders and exclusive membership. The citizenship I learned from the WordPress community is one that accepts everyone as they come with one main condition, to genuinely want what’s best for each member and the community as a whole without necessarily needing to agree on what that means. I also learned how to deal with the tension of trying to fit in when you have traits that force you to stand out.</p>\n<h3>Real Diversity</h3>\n<p>The WordPress community’s acceptance of diversity doesn’t just mean accepting people as they are, but pushing them to do their best for themselves and society. I have learned from the WP community to lean into my abilities, and also find the best ways to improve on my weaknesses. As an introvert I’ve learned to cultivate my personal interactions at meetups and WordCamps and it has created many opportunities. I’ve also learned from other introverts to pace myself when I attend social events. There’s no need to shake everyone’s hand (or fist bump since the pandemic). It’s also good for me to plan ahead for a day away from the world to recharge after big social events.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite hacks has come from conversations about accessibility. I discovered that using a screen reader increased my dismal reading speed from 150 words per minute to the average person’s reading speed of 250!</p>\n<h3>Getting Practical</h3>\n<p>Finding myself is all well and good, but I still need to make a living. I have struggled in that regard. I tried being a freelancer, and working as a web designer/developer for companies, but never found the right fit. I’ve given myself excuses like slow internet or a crappy laptop. In 2019 we had daily 13-hour electricity blackouts that disrupted life for everyone who couldn’t afford backup power during the day as electricity was only available at night. All very good excuses, but there’ll always be excuses no matter what you are doing.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve been asked where the money is from this “W” thing I do, and when I’ll get a proper job, and I never had a definite answer.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I come from a utilitarian culture where direct input should always equal direct results. I initially tried applying the same thinking to my WP journey, but it’s not as simple as planting a seed, giving it water and fertilizer and watching it grow. That is where personal growth becomes a practical tool. There is no absolute formula to success.

Plus, it has a built-in dark mode design that did not make me want to rip my eyes from their sockets. I had planned to review it, but I did not have much to say. It is simply a solid design without much in the way of extras.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in the particular test environment I had set up, one piece of it was broken. I ran into a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/block-based-themes-and-the-problem-with-dynamic-data-in-html-templates\">longstanding issue</a> with the block system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The default &ldquo;intro&rdquo; image used on the homepage will return a 404 if WordPress is not installed in the root directory or if the <code>/wp-content</code> folder has been moved. I switched it to another test site using the default configuration to make it appear.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Bai theme homepage.\n\n\n\n<p>This is not the fault of the developer. Block themes currently have no way to add dynamic values in their templates. Therefore, the only solution is to hotlink an image from a third-party site or add a static URL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a not-so-trivial issue that has, at least in part, hampered the momentum of block theme development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since themes have been around, they have output data via PHP functions. When using block templates, everything is HTML and bits of JSON data. The dynamic parts are the blocks themselves. This works well enough for at least 90% (probably more) of scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where theme authors run into trouble are the cases where there is no existing block or way of adding dynamic data inline. Some use cases include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Printing internationalized text strings.</li><li>Outputting the current year in the footer copyright section.</li><li>Adding image URLs.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not so much that these things absolutely must be dynamic. Users are expected to edit the content via the site editor. However, the experience is not ideal if an image returns a 404 status when users have a different directory structure. Or when their theme has bits and pieces of English scattered throughout when using the Spanish translation. Before block themes officially land in WordPress, this must be fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/33217\">open ticket slated for Gutenberg 11.8</a> that addresses this issue through a new Pattern block. Essentially, it would allow themes to output a pattern within templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;!-- wp:pattern {\"slug\":\"namespace/pattern-name\"} /--&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason this works is that patterns are defined via PHP. Theme authors can use internationalization functions like <code>__()</code>, print out the date with <code>date_i18n()</code>, or output an image URL with <code>get_theme_file_uri()</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This upcoming feature closed an earlier proposal for a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/33192\">standalone i18n block</a>. It should also tackle the multiple ideas on an earlier issue for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/20966\">dynamic data in static HTML files</a>. Another one for including <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/31815\">images in block templates</a>.  A proposal from 2020 for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/21830\">using patterns in templates.</a>  And, I am sure a host of other tickets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The push will likely happen because the upcoming default theme, Twenty Twenty-Two, needs it. Developers currently need to figure out how to show the default <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentytwo/issues/92\">flying bird image</a> on the homepage and add <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentytwo/pull/56\">internationalized footer credit text</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Twenty Twenty-Two homepage design.\n\n\n\n<p>I like the concept here. Developers add the Pattern block within their templates. In the site editor, the pattern is shown and persists until a user makes a direct edit. Then, it behaves like any other set of blocks, and the content is no longer dynamic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A side benefit of this feature is that it could also solve a duplicate code issue and allows theme authors to follow the DRY principle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When creating templates or template parts, some theme authors duplicate the same content as user-selectable block patterns. Instead of having the code in two places, they can register it once as a pattern and call it within the template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Pattern block is not officially merged yet, it looks to be the best solution to the dynamic content issue with block themes.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 23:24:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"HeroPress: Investing In The WordPress Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=4216\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:139:\"https://heropress.com/investing-in-the-wordpress-community/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=investing-in-the-wordpress-community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1340:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/hannah-busing-Zyx1bK9mqmA-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"people with their hands in the middle of a circle together\" /><p>Seven years ago HeroPress was started to inspire and give hope to WordPress community members, particularly those who might feel excluded from the mainstream WordPress community.

Recent check-ins on the progress have further narrowed the scope from what Matias Ventura previously <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/08/13/preliminary-road-to-5-9/\">projected</a> to include &ldquo;both the navigation block and navigation screen projects.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The Nav Editor will not be included in WordPress 5.9 because changes to the block are required for the editor to be a success,&rdquo; Automattic engineer and core contributor Dave Smith <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/29102#issuecomment-947554777\">said</a>. &ldquo;We need to allow sufficient time to test the editor before any major release and allow for community feedback.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During a recent <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/10/15/summary-navigation-editor-and-block-hallway-hangout/\">Hallway Hangout meeting</a>, contributors discussed some of the challenges they have encountered in working on the Navigation Editor. Smith said the outcome of that meeting was that &ldquo;contributor efforts will switch to the Nav block in order to resolve some of the underlying architectural issues.&rdquo; Contributors and participants in the meeting agreed that the Navigation Editor needs to be on hold until the Navigation Block has been shipped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smith summarized the scope update for block-based Navigation in WordPress 5.9 and the changes to the block that are necessary for the project to move forward:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>specifically separating the navigation&rsquo;s presentation from its data in order to make navigations reusable. This serves both the Nav Editor project and the WordPress 5.9 release in general.</li><li>The Navigation Editor will ultimately focus on manipulating the&nbsp;<em>data</em>&nbsp;of a navigation which is why the above work is a prerequisite for the project&rsquo;s success.</li><li>Work on the Nav Editor will resume after WordPress 5.9. We will continue to focus on backwards compatibility whilst looking ahead to the world of blocks.</li><li>It&rsquo;s unlikely that we will pursue a new &ldquo;Classic Menu&rdquo; block. Rather focusing on the Navigation block (or its data).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the effort to separate the navigation&rsquo;s presentation from its data, contributors are considering two important PR&rsquo;s that explore different approaches:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35746\">Save Navigation Block data to a wp_navigation post type&nbsp;#35746</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35418\">Try using a template part in the navigation block&nbsp;#35418</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Discussion on the the merits and detriments of both approaches will continue before contributors select one to embrace moving forward. Smith identified the following goals as being important factors for the architectural decision:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Allow navigations to be used in different locations within the same template/site.</li><li>Allow reuse of the same navigation&nbsp;<em>data</em>&nbsp;but with different&nbsp;<em>presentational</em>&nbsp;treatments.</li><li>Retain ability to quickly build new navigations.</li><li>Separate presentation and data in order to afford editing navigation data in isolation (e.g. Nav Editor project).</li><li>Allow reuse of navigations across themes.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Although having a complete Navigation Editor would be ideal for launching alongside WordPress 5.9&rsquo;s other full-site editing features, it makes sense that contributors are taking their time deliberating the architectural approach that will define menus in WordPress for the foreseeable future. Anyone with strong opinions on the future of Navigation in WordPress should test the PR&rsquo;s and weigh in on the discussion.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 04:09:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: Designing Block-Based WordPress Child Themes With a Single JSON File\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=124768\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:201:\"https://wptavern.com/designing-block-based-wordpress-child-themes-with-a-single-json-file?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=designing-block-based-wordpress-child-themes-with-a-single-json-file\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7504:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">From the moment I opened my first theme shop back in 2008 to the present day as someone who merely tinkers, my plan has always been to build a single theme in the mold of <a href=\"http://www.csszengarden.com/\">CSS Zen Garden</a>. This was a project that Dave Shea launched in the early 2000s to show how designers could manipulate a site through CSS alone. The HTML would stay the same, but the design could be anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have achieved that goal multiple times with several projects. Technically, all I ever needed was architecturally sound markup in a WordPress theme and custom CSS in a child theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept was simple, but over time, my vision changed. I wanted to create something that made designing these types of child themes even easier. Therefore, I built custom systems to work around WordPress&rsquo;s lack of tools in the theme design realm. Not to boast too much, but I felt like I had created some handy methods. They allowed child theme designers to plug values into config files, such as font-family names and color codes. Most of these could also be overwritten by end-users via the customizer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By 2018, I was already hard at work on what would be my magnum opus, the best WordPress theme I had ever built. I had also planned on it being my last. I had been considering getting out of the game for a while. But, this was a project that I had to see through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, the new block editor blew everything up. I had worked with it for months before it launched, but I knew theme development would never be the same. The Gutenberg project would continue maturing and reshape WordPress&rsquo;s future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I eventually launched my theme. It was one of the earliest commercial products that supported the new block system. However, I was also deflated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These were the early block editor days. No one really knew what we would be looking at in three or more years, but if you were paying even a modicum of attention, you could see that theming would evolve into something far different than it was at the time. I spent over a year building a theming system that would become irrelevant in short order &mdash; granted, I thought we would have arrived at this destination much sooner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-9-go-no-go-update-all-proposed-features-are-moving-forward\">WordPress 5.9 will ship</a> the final sub-components of Full Site Editing. This will include support for block themes under the hood. Users who install them can customize them through the site editor and the global styles interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What excites me the most is still the thing that woke me up every morning 13 years ago: child themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block child themes have partially worked in the Gutenberg plugin for months. However, the feature that I was looking forward to the most was not ready until a week ago. A new patch <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35459\">allows a child theme to overwrite</a> single values of its parent&rsquo;s <code>theme.json</code> file. Essentially, the two files are merged, with the child taking precedence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Why was I so excited about this feature?</em> Because it was the same system I had built in years past &mdash; but better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After seeing this land in the development version of Gutenberg, the first thing I did was load up a custom theme I have been dabbling with. It is a project that I have been building for fun and my own edification.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Single post view of parent theme.\n\n\n\n<p>Then, I created a new project in my code editor. I added the required <code>style.css</code> file and plugged in the appropriate header fields. I would not need it beyond that. My child theme&rsquo;s design would rely on another feature altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I added a <code>theme.json</code> at the child theme&rsquo;s root level and began having more fun than I have had with theming in a long while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I picked out a couple of autumn colors and a fun heading font. Within a few minutes, I had a new coat of paint splashed across my test install. The design was not revolutionary or anything of the sort. I was just amazed at how easy it was to transform my design by plugging in a few values.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Single post view of child theme.\n\n\n\n<p>This is the type of child theming I have always longed for. I want the power to switch my theme&rsquo;s design elements around for various seasons and holidays. And I want to be able to share these child themes with others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, I had built such methods of child theming before (I used PHP instead of JSON). However, this is much more powerful because it relies on the standard block system and not something custom that only a handful of people would ever use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of you may ask why I did not make these changes via the site editor instead of creating a child theme. Rich Tabor posed, essentially, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/richard_tabor/status/1452611152089862160\">the same question on Twitter</a> earlier today. &ldquo;If a theme consists of JSON and block templates that can both be modified via Global Styles, then what are child themes for?&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us say that I have installed a block theme and made a few color adjustments. Now, pretend that I want to mix this up when Christmas rolls around &mdash; throw in a few colors and find a festive holiday font. When I make these changes, my old design will no longer be there when the season ends because user customizations are stored based on the active theme. I could, of course, make a note of all my old settings and change them all back later. However, doing it via a child theme means that I can merely switch themes at any time. My old settings would remain intact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps this is very much an edge case. <em>Who is making seasonal changes to their design these days, right?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exciting part is that I can share child themes built with a single JSON file with others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Child theming has been a passion of mine since the feature landed in WordPress. In some respects, it has not changed much. Themers can still overwrite templates from the parent. They can continue adding custom CSS if they want to. But now, they can configure any part of the design from a single standardized file. That is something worth putting my developer&rsquo;s cap back on for and building one more theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also see a child-theme-less future that still has the same benefits of sharing design elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block pattern directory already provides layouts that should work with any well-built WordPress theme. However, there are other components of design that we could break apart in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I imagine a future where WordPress could have installable color palettes like what <a href=\"https://www.colourlovers.com/\">Colour Lovers</a> offers.

Of Full site- editing, all you will see in 5.9 is a sneak preview of what will be, in an impressive way. But that doesn&#8217;t change anything, if you don&#8217;t want it to. There won&#8217;t be an overnight automatic update of your site, and you don&#8217;t know how to handle it. I understand the fear, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last five years, there was  plenty of doomsday amplification. That&#8217;s what social networks depend on for advertising.

Or as I phrase it &#8211; nothing&#8217;s perfect, nothing lasts and nothing is ever finished. There is beauty in it and there is peace in it. And there is exciting creative and brilliant work being done on all the WordPress teams. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am very happy that you are here, so I can tell you about it.

Once you look past the ClickBait headline and the expression of personal frustrations, there isn&#8217;t much you can argue with Ferriman. He is right. Gutenberg is not a page builder. Yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Only with WordPress 5.9, will we see the <strong>first </strong>version of site editing, template, template parts and a user interface to change some global designs. Built in the open, the full-site editing part in the next version, will only give users an idea what Gutenberg can become in terms of page building. It will not hold comparisons with page builders that have many years of development in their own universe. Elementor is in its fifth year, Beaver Builder in it&#8217;s seventh year. Gutenberg full-site editing? Not yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">If you want to see what is possible at the moment, watch <strong>Anne McCarthy </strong>demostrating in this five minute video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPU-sT96f2g\"><strong>Using duotone in theme.json to customize your image blocks</strong></a>.

While still <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/build-forms-via-the-block-editor-with-gutenberg-forms\">rough around the edges</a> a year ago, the plugin was updated regularly and was something to at least keep an eye on as it matured. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/extendify-acquires-editor-plus-introduces-commercial-templates-in-its-plan-to-improve-block-editing\">Extendify acquired it</a> alongside Kamal&rsquo;s Editor Plus and Gutenberg Hub at the end of 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, Gutenberg Forms seemed to stall. Since Extendify took over the project, outside of bug fixes, most of the changes revolved around the addition of its commercial template and pattern library. However, the plugin still racked up over 1,000 active installs and a 4.6-star rating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cristian Raiber, the CEO of <a href=\"https://wpchill.com/\">WPChill</a>, said he had discussed acquiring the plugin early on. However, he backed out before closing the deal because his company already owned <a href=\"https://kaliforms.com/\">Kali Forms</a>, a commercial forms solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;After a while of not gaining enough market share with Kali Forms, we circled back, and luckily, this time around, Chris Lubkert, the CEO of Extendify, was actually looking for someone to take over the project (adopt it) and keep it going,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no plans to merge the two form solutions. Both plugins serve different markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Kali Forms is a more complex and complete solution whereas Gutenberg Forms just focuses on simpler forms, which also makes it limited in functionality but also in scope,&rdquo; said Raiber. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a market for people who just need a basic form solution built into Gutenberg, and we just happen to be the new owners of that solution.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg Forms is still in its infancy, and there are many paths the new development team could take. Given enough time and resources, WPChill could shake up the free forms market.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Building a simple contact form with Gutenberg Forms.\n\n\n\n<p>The first order of business will be clearing the backlog of issues, according to Raiber. Then, his team will focus on new features as requested by users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Features such as the ability to build Quizzes or even more field types that will unlock even more powerful form types,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s also quite a bit of overlap with our existing plugins. A bunch of our plugins are already providing a form functionality that&rsquo;s&hellip;well, kind of limited and hard to maintain at the same time. A goal I&rsquo;d see us pursuing is removing those form components from our existing plugins and instead recommending Gutenberg Forms as a one-click install module.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such a solution would allow his team to focus its efforts on a single code base. Then, they can extend their other plugins without recreating bits and pieces across each project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;For our Strong Testimonials plugin, we&rsquo;ve had people ask several times if the form collection plugin could be used for something else as well,&rdquo; said Raiber. &ldquo;Right now, that&rsquo;s not possible, unfortunately. We&rsquo;ve got a knowledge base + help desk plugin as well that could benefit from an enhanced form solution, such as Gutenberg Forms.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, his team is about halfway through migrating all of their plugins into the block system. He said they are fully committed and on board with being a &ldquo;Gutenberg-first&rdquo; plugin shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The market&rsquo;s full of form plugins, and they&rsquo;re all competing on features, pricing, and really complex scenarios,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But what happens to those people that just need a simpler solution for free? My really long-term goal here is to be able to keep Gutenberg Forms 100% free and maybe become a worthy alternative to the aging Contact Form 7, a form solution that&rsquo;s got a really huge technical debt and has been poised with a lot of bugs. And that&rsquo;s normal for a plugin that&rsquo;s grown that big and has been around for that long without a team around it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Raiber wanted to point out that they are not looking to compete with popular commercial solutions with Gutenberg Forms. A paid version is not even on the roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Commercially, they plan to integrate with their other projects and get users to jump on their other pro plugins. The goal is to disrupt the free forms market.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 23 Oct 2021 00:13:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"Post Status: Post Status Excerpt (No. 29) — Better Ways To Support Customers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=88157\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://poststatus.com/excerpt/29/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4341:\"<h2>&#8220;If you\'re a founder of a company go through your own customer experience yourself — with your own eyes.&#8221;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In this episode of Post Status Excerpt, Cory and David talk about their best and worst support experiences as customers.

There is a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/dynamic-social-images-for-plugins-themes-and-patterns-yes-please\">proposal to dynamically generate them</a> for plugins and themes hosted on WordPress.org. And, there is a new player in town: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/branded-social-images/\">Branded Social Images</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, I have had a mild obsession lately with the concept, and I would like to see the Tavern use dynamically-generated social images at some point. Because we already use Jetpack, I will wait to see where its development team takes the feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Branded Social Images is a solid addition to the WordPress plugin directory for those who want a solution now. It is not as featured-filled as Social Image Generator, which is no longer available for purchase. However, it is an introduction to the concept for those trying it out for the first time. And, it may just prove well-rounded enough for many users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin was <a href=\"https://www.clearsite.nl/branded-social-images/\">released by Internetbureau Clearsite</a>, a web development and design agency. Branded Social Images is the team&rsquo;s first extension on WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite feature from this plugin is that it allows users to upload any TTF or OTF font file for the social image&rsquo;s text. I tested it with the Oleo Script Swash Caps and Rampart One font families to see how it worked.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li></ul>Testing custom font families.\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I tested with several more than that, but I had to stop myself before going too far. I have a font addiction and am easily sucked into hours of tinkering with them. The goal was to test this plugin feature, and it worked as it was supposed to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin already packages a reasonable set of 10 font families to choose from out of the box. If nothing suits your fancy, just snag one from Google Fonts or another site of your choosing and upload the <code>.ttf</code> or <code>.otf</code> file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Branded Social Images is straightforward to use. Its settings screen has a preview image at the top and two boxes with settings. One for the social image text. The other is for the background image and logo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where it fails to live up to the competition is that it does not have any pre-built templates. This is not necessarily a make-or-break feature, but it also does not have the design options to recreate many of the layouts of something like Social Image Generator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, the layout options boil down to positioning a logo and text atop a background image via a three-by-three grid.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li></ul>Plugin options.\n\n\n\n<p>However, its scaled-back interface with minimal options could be seen as a feature in and of itself. Not everyone needs or desires a swath of settings when a few baseline customizations will do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did have some trouble understanding whether the placeholder logo could be removed. After some testing, I realized it was limited to the settings screen unless I explicitly uploaded a custom one. I would also like to see an option to use the site title instead &mdash; not every site has a logo but might still want to show their brand name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can also modify the social image on a per-post basis. The plugin adds a meta box with four options on the post-editing screen for:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Disabling the social image.</li><li>Editing the text.</li><li>Disabling the text.</li><li>Adding a custom image.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<img />Per-post social image options.\n\n\n\n<p>By default, the text will be the post&rsquo;s document title. It should work with most SEO plugins, such as Yoast SEO. The featured image will also be swapped in for the background if a custom one is not added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After three years of using the current WordPress post editor, it still catches me off-guard when a plugin puts a meta box at the bottom of the screen instead of the sidebar. It always looks out of place. In this case, it takes up a ton of real estate for four options, and there is no need for it. If I could wave a magic wand and change one thing about the plugin, this would be it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin also breaks the cardinal rule of not adding a top-level admin menu item for a single screen. WordPress literally allows for sub-menu items under Settings. <em>So, maybe I need that magic wand for two things.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of a few issues, I love what the plugin team has created thus far. It is a little rough around the edges, but that is OK for a version 1.x. Software is meant to be iterated and improved upon, and Branded Social Images has the foundation for becoming even better.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 00:35:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"WPTavern: Jetpack Launches Commercial Backup Feature as a Standalone Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=124622\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:195:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-launches-commercial-backup-feature-as-a-standalone-plugin?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=jetpack-launches-commercial-backup-feature-as-a-standalone-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3577:\"<p>Jetpack is splitting out its <a href=\"https://cloud.jetpack.com/pricing\">commercial Backup feature</a> into a standalone plugin that can be used without installing the core Jetpack plugin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The commercial product includes automated daily or real-time backups with one-click restores, even for sites that are offline. Backups include all WordPress database, theme, and plugin files, which are stored on WordPress.com&rsquo;s infrastructure with redundant copies on multiple servers. The product was built with WooCommerce in mind and can restore a site to any past state while keeping current orders and products in place. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jetpack representative Rob Pugh <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2021/10/21/meet-jetpack-backup-now-as-a-standalone-plugin/\">said</a> the product was split out of the core plugin because &ldquo;many developers and site owners asked for the flexibility to use specific components of Jetpack as part of their own, custom-built &lsquo;tech stack&rsquo; of plugins.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The standalone plugin is available on WordPress.org and requires a user connection to WordPress.com. It is essentially a shell for connecting the commercial product, as the plugin doesn&rsquo;t have a free tier or perform any function unless you click &ldquo;Upgrade Now.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin&rsquo;s description on WordPress.org is somewhat misleading, as it isn&rsquo;t explicit that this is a commercial-only product. The &ldquo;Get Started&rdquo; section states, &ldquo;Installation is free, quick, and easy. It only takes a few minutes to install Jetpack Backup.&rdquo; The fact that it&rsquo;s a paid product isn&rsquo;t evident unless you dig into the accordion FAQ section about how to create a backup: &ldquo;As soon as you purchase Jetpack Backup, it will be activated, and the first backup will be completed.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The launch of the new standalone plugin should not affect current Jetpack customers using the backup services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same engine that powers the backup solution that&rsquo;s part of the full Jetpack plugin and we&rsquo;ve developed loaders to only load the engine once&mdash;whether you have only Jetpack, only this, or both,&rdquo; Jetpack engineer Brandon Kraft <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kraft/status/1428101956879454210\">said</a>. &ldquo;If you have Jetpack already, this adds some UI for you, but the same service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The loader tech is the same that ensures the connection code only loads once between this, Jetpack, Boost, WooCommerce Payments, etc and ensure the latest version is running. [You] don&rsquo;t have to load into memory more than you need.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jetpack is often criticized for being &ldquo;bloated&rdquo; and bundling too many features. In 2019, the Jetpack team began <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-is-promoting-paid-upgrades-on-plugin-search-screen-wordpress-plugin-team-says-it-may-be-a-violation-of-directory-guidelines\">promoting feature suggestions on the plugin search screen</a> in an attempt to solve a discovery problem, where users are quite often not familiar with the plugin&rsquo;s dozens of modules and end up installing plugins to perform functionality that Jetpack already includes. Splitting the backup feature out into its own plugin should be helpful on this front and is part of a long-term plan to make Jetpack more modular. Jetpack Backup joins Jetpack CRM and Jetpack Boost, two features already available as standalone plugins outside of the core plugin.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 22:56:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"Post Status: Membership and Courses with Sean McCabe\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=88020\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-live-membership-and-courses-with-sean-mccabe/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3578:\"<h2>&#8220;It\'s easier to sell courses today&#8230; what hasn\'t changed is HOW you sell and the validation of what you\'re selling.&#8221;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\"><strong>Cory Miller</strong> talks with <strong>Sean McCabe</strong>, CEO of <strong>Seanwes Media</strong>.

Today, the duo announced the opening of <a href=\"https://finditwp.com/\">Find It WP</a>, a new site that is part of the collective. It will serve as a database or archive of all things WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal is ambitious, and it is powered by submissions from the community. The site is open to anyone who wants to share a WordPress-related resource. &ldquo;Resources&rdquo; in this sense is literally anything. It can be a plugin, agency, podcast, theme shop, or even more. And, if there is not a category available, submitters can recommend a new one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This new way to search WordPress resources helps both veteran and beginner users by saving them time and frustration as they try to find what they need,&rdquo; wrote Cate DeRosia in the <a href=\"https://heropressnetwork.com/a-new-wordpress-resource-archive-find-it-wp/\">announcement post</a>. &ldquo;Often, I&rsquo;ve seen someone tweet out that they&rsquo;re looking for a WooCommerce specialist or have a friend ask me if I know of a plugin that does x. Now everyone has a new place to start: Find It WP.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the submissions are manually approved to make sure the content is appropriate. This will add to the team&rsquo;s workload. DeRosia jokingly said her role has become &ldquo;Chief Approval Officer.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Partial view of the resource submission form.\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;And this really highlights the reason we&rsquo;ll be reaching out for funding,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot to maintain with the new additions to the HeroPress Network, resources that seem like they&rsquo;ll be a real asset to the growth of the WordPress community. Instead of each company trying to do this on their own, let&rsquo;s pool our resources and support it together.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current plan is to open some funding options for the HeroPress Network on October 24. DeRosia said in an <a href=\"https://heropressnetwork.com/introducing-the-heropress-network/\">earlier announcement</a> that this would be similar to Patreon, where users could fund the mission. However, they will also have a corporate sponsorship program for WordPress businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think of it like the local library,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Not everyone needs to be in there checking out books and shelving things, but somebody does, and they have to buy groceries, too.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeRosia believes this will benefit individuals as well as smaller and larger agencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;You never know where a customer is going to come from or what up and coming agency could give you unexpected competition, so this is a simple way to see what all is going on in the WordPress ecosystem,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also an ideal opportunity to find smaller products and business larger companies may want to acquire.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked her whether including plugins and themes was worth it because there are already dedicated directories and marketplaces for those types of resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We had the same thoughts as you about whether it was worth including plugins and themes, particularly free ones,&rdquo; she responded. She listed four primary reasons they thought it was worth doing:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If it&rsquo;s for &ldquo;all things WordPress,&rdquo; we need to include all things WordPress.</li><li>We liked that free and paid plugins were searchable alongside each other.</li><li>The WordPress repositories don&rsquo;t have our advanced searching. We&rsquo;re not a replacement for them, just an additional option.</li><li>Reviews can negatively impact products that don&rsquo;t always deserve them. We wanted to level the playing field there.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>DeRosia said the idea for this project and <a href=\"https://wppodcasts.com/\">WP Podcasts</a> came along at about the same time (note: the WP Tavern podcast is <a href=\"https://wppodcasts.com/podcast/wp-tavern/\">listed on the site</a>). The latter was less ambitious in scope, so they launched it first as a case study.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;From the beginning, the driving force behind the HeroPress expansion was to create bridges between the various WordPress communities, and Find It WP seemed like a natural element to that,&rdquo; said DeRosia. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really difficult to be successful and stay on top of an ever-growing ecosystem like WordPress. With Find It WP, we can simplify it all, for both searchers and those looking to be found.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spent the last 18 months looking at ways people can get visibility in the WordPress Community, and it&rsquo;s nearly impossible. It&rsquo;s so large and spread out that, even if you have the most amazing new product, it&rsquo;s hard to get noticed. Find It WP simplifies all of that and provides equitable opportunities for anyone.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equity is a a crucial part of this project, leveling the playing field for creators regardless of their size. There is no special attention given to major players. The resources are simply there for people to search for and find what they are looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment, there are currently 42 listings spread across multiple categories. DeRosia said she was getting back to approving more as we ended our chat. As the site grows, it should offer opportunities for more businesses and people to connect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The idea for Find It WP did come out of our experiences with HeroPress and expanding into the HeroPress Network,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve needed help along the way and have been thrilled by the talent we&rsquo;ve come across. If we hadn&rsquo;t been looking or had the connections we had, we wouldn&rsquo;t have found them. We didn&rsquo;t want to keep that to ourselves. We want everyone to be able to experience the benefits that come from working together as a community.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Topher DeRosia also published a <a href=\"https://heropress.com/a-new-heropress-family-member/\">Find It WP announcement</a> on the HeroPress blog.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 21:58:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"HeroPress: A New HeroPress Family Member\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=4190\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:125:\"https://heropress.com/a-new-heropress-family-member/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=a-new-heropress-family-member\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2398:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2121/10/marten-newhall-uAFjFsMS3YY-unsplash-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" /><p>Last summer when Cate and I were on our anniversary trip we were brainstorming about new things we could bring to the WordPress community that would really help people. Cate came up with the idea of a site that lists every single WordPress resource in the entire world. I was a little dubious at first, but she pitched it well, and I came around. We&#8217;ve spent months planning, building, starting over, and dreaming about it at night, and today we released <a href=\"http://FindItWP.com\">FindItWP.com</a> as part of the <a href=\"https://heropressnetwork.com\">HeroPress Network</a>.</p>\n<h3>So What Is It?</h3>\n<p>Imagine a list of every WordPress resource in the world. Every podcast, every email newsletter, every plugin, every theme, every agency for hire, every news outlet, every training site, etc. Then imagine you can search and filter it, to find exactly what you&#8217;re looking for.</p>\n<p>Now also imagine you&#8217;re a small plugin or theme shop selling a product, struggling to get visibility an overwhelming world. You can get your item listed on an equal platform as places that have far more marketing resources.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s <a href=\"https://finditwp.com\">FindItWP.com</a>.</p>\n<h3>Who Is It For?</h3>\n<p>Anyone who wants to find something, and anyone who wants to be found.</p>\n<h3>Can I Help?</h3>\n<p>Yes! The entire foundation of Find It WP is the community entering all the resources.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no way a single person, or even a large group could handle it.&nbsp; It has to be all of us or it won&#8217;t really work. Anyone can enter any resource, even if it&#8217;s not theirs. Then if the owner wants to take over the listed we&#8217;ll facilitate that.

A few of its member projects include BusyBox, Git, Homebrew, OpenWrt, and phpMyAdmin. As part of its mission, the Conservancy assists member projects in enforcing the terms of FLOSS licenses, including through litigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Software Freedom Conservancy contends that Vizio&rsquo;s TV products contain software with copyleft licenses but the company refused to provide the source code after multiple attempts at contact since 2018. Vizio also did not inform its customers about the rights included with the software it was bundling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We filed suit as a purchaser of TVs to stand up for copyleft,&rdquo; Software Freedom Conservancy Executive Director Karen Sandler said. &ldquo;There was no source or offer for source even after we&rsquo;d been working with them for a long time on older products. Copyleft can help us take control of our tech in a meaningful way, it&rsquo;s a huge benefit to consumers.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a new twist on GPL enforcement, the organization is presenting this lawsuit on behalf of individual consumers, as opposed to the traditional path of defending copyright holders of the GPL code in question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Software Freedom Conservancy contends that Vizio&rsquo;s alleged noncompliance prevents consumers from being able to repair their devices, improve and control them, as well as curtail surveillance and ads through modifications. The <a href=\"https://sfconservancy.org/docs/conservancy-v-vizio-original-complaint-2021-10-19.pdf\">full text of the complaint</a> includes examples of how consumers might benefit from having access to the source code:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Vizio is unlikely to unilaterally implement features that prevent the collection of such user data, as such user data is valuable to Vizio. Access to the Source Code of the Linux kernel, the other SmartCast Programs at Issue, and for the Library Linking Programs, as used on Vizio smart TVs, would enable software developers to preserve useful but obsolete features. It would also allow software developers to maintain and update the operating system should Vizio or its successor ever decide to abandon it or go out of business. In these ways, purchasers of Vizio smart TVs can be confident that their devices would not suffer from software-induced obsolescence, planned or otherwise.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In the organization&rsquo;s announcement of the lawsuit, Sandler highlighted the environmental impact of denying consumers access to the code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The global supply chain shortages that have affected everything from cars to consumer electronics underscore one of the reasons why it is important to be able to repair products we already own,&rdquo; says Sandler. &ldquo;Even without supply chain challenges, the forced obsolescence of devices like TVs isn&rsquo;t in the best interest of the consumer or even the planet. This is another aspect of what we mean by &lsquo;ethical technology.&rsquo; Throwing away a TV because its software is no longer supported by its manufacturer is not only wasteful, it has dire environmental consequences. Consumers should have more control over this, and they would if companies like Vizio played by the rules.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The complaint alleges that Vizio is in breach of the GPLv2 and the LGPLv2.1 every time they distribute a smart TV without the source code or a written offer to provide it. It claims that none of the smart TVs Vizio has introduced in the US market in the past four years have been accompanied by the source code. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open source leaders from affiliate organizations commented on the unique approach of this lawsuit, where the Conservancy is acting on behalf of consumers as the plaintiff, as opposed to prevailing upon the copyright holder to defend its users. The complaint states:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>No one other than the purchaser has both the information and motive to enforce the Source Code Provision. Purchasers will both know whether the Source Code Provision has been honored and have a desire to examine and further develop the corresponding source code.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;If this consumer-rights-based approach succeeds, the main excuse for copyright assignments to organizations like the FSF will be gone and we can unambiguously treat a CLA as a red flag,&rdquo; Open Source Initiative Director of Standards/Policy Simon Phipps said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The complaint states that the &ldquo;Plaintiff and other members of the class of persons intended to benefit from the GPLv2 and LGPLv2.1 have been damaged in an amount that cannot be readily determined.&rdquo; Vizio&rsquo;s alleged noncompliance has effectively stunted the source code&rsquo;s potential for improvements from consumers for years. It has also robbed consumers of the control of their electronics and given Vizio an unfair advantage that protects their corporate interests at the expense of users&rsquo; freedoms. The Conservancy is not seeking an exact amount for damages but rather leaving it to the judgment of the court. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This lawsuit has the potential to empower many consumers, radically changing the landscape of consumer technology,&rdquo; Open Source Initiative Executive Director Stefano Maffulli said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Conservancy&rsquo;s case will be an important one to watch, as its decision could set a precedent for GPL enforcement in the future. If nothing else, it should signal to companies benefiting from GPL-licensed code that they must also respect consumers&rsquo; rights. If consumers are the intended third-party beneficiaries of the license agreement, then they have a right to the source code. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 20:07:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"WPTavern: Tidying the Media Library With WP Ninjas’ Remove Unused Media Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=124177\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:199:\"https://wptavern.com/tidying-the-media-library-with-wp-ninjas-remove-unused-media-plugin?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=tidying-the-media-library-with-wp-ninjas-remove-unused-media-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6172:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">A few weeks ago, <a href=\"https://wp-ninjas.de/remove-unused-media\">WP Ninjas announced</a> it was stepping into the media optimization plugin market. The team released its <a href=\"https://remove-unused-media.com/en\">Remove Unused Media</a> plugin as a commercial project for tidying storage space. I received a full copy of it and put it through the ropes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With so many commercial plugins, I am accustomed to the developers creating an entirely new menu item, taking up precious admin real estate. This happens even with those that just have a single screen too. However, I was happy to see the WP Ninjas team tucked everything neatly under &ldquo;Media&rdquo; as a sub-menu. We were off to a good start, and things only got better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I review plugins, there is one thing that I consistently preach: simplicity. That begins with following the core WordPress UI and sticking as closely to it as the plugin&rsquo;s features will allow. In essence, <em>don&rsquo;t make me think</em> about how to use your plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part, Remove Unused Media got the user experience right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could nitpick a few design choices with the interface, such as modifying the list table with rounded corners and extra padding. The &ldquo;filter&rdquo; sub-navigation also deviates from the standard. And, the &ldquo;last analysis&rdquo; message should receive the WordPress admin notice treatment so that it stands out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all core UI elements with unnecessary customizations. However, they did not diminish the experience on the whole. The plugin mostly stuck with the WordPress standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real question is whether the plugin does what it says on the tin. <em>What is the experience of removing unused media like?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was easy. Users merely need to click the &ldquo;Start Analysis&rdquo; button and wait a few seconds. The plugin then has three tabs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Unused Media</li><li>Used Media</li><li>Ignored</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Unused Media tab presents an overview of all media that the plugin could not find used on the site. There is a possibility that it missed something. However, I only found one old-school scenario where this happened, which I will dive into later.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Unused media screen.\n\n\n\n<p>From this point, end-users can manually delete individual media attachments or use the bulk-delete option. Before doing so, the plugin recommends making a backup of the site &mdash; solid advice for any such plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite feature of the plugin was not its primary feature of deleting media. It was actually the &ldquo;Used Media&rdquo; screen. Its &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How?&rdquo; columns break down where images, videos, and other files are used and in what context.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Used media screen.\n\n\n\n<p>It reminded me of the &ldquo;instances&rdquo; screen for the WordPress <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/version-1-prototype-of-the-wordpress-admin-block-directory-announced\">admin block directory proposal</a> from 2019. The concept showed where specific blocks were used across the site. Remove Unused Media does the same thing for media files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &ldquo;Ignore&rdquo; tab for the plugin keeps track of media files that should not be deleted, even if they are unused. Users can click a link from the other screens to add them to the list. This persists after running a new analysis too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin scans several third-party plugins like Elementor, Beaver Builder, ACF, and Yoast SEO. Some store media instances outside of the post content, such as in custom post meta, and Remove Unused Media searches those specific fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://remove-unused-media.com/en/pricing/\">Pricing</a> starts at 39&euro; ($45.38 at today&rsquo;s exchange rate) for one year of support and updates for a single site. It also has a five-site option at 149&euro; and a 100-site tier at 299&euro;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first version, the user experience felt solid. However, it does not have much in the way of customizability. That could be a sticking point for users who are looking for a more flexible premium option.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Exploring Alternatives</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The plugin is not the first of its kind. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/media-cleaner/\">Media Cleaner</a> plugin by Meow Apps is free, routinely updated, and has over 40,000 active installations. It also has a commercial version with more features, such as third-party plugin integration, WP-CLI support, filesystem scan, and live-site analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Media Cleaner plugin results.\n\n\n\n<p>The UI for Remove Unused Media feels more like WordPress. Its &ldquo;Used&rdquo; tab also shows where (i.e., what posts) and how (e.g., content, featured image) specific media files are used across the site. This feature alone makes it worthwhile for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One area where Media Cleaner shines is its option for ignoring (not deleting) attached media. This is a vital feature if users have ever added the old <code>gallery</code> shortcode. At one point, WordPress simply displayed all attached images as a gallery. Eventually, it specified the IDs in the shortcode. However, for those older instances, this was not the case. Without enabling this option, those media items might get queued up for deletion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Remove Unused Media plugin does not have such an option. Attached images that are not explicitly used are considered unused. This may not be an issue for most users, but those with old gallery shortcodes should be aware of potential problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The baseline features for both are similar. Remove Unused Media gets the edge in its default user interface and experience. However, Media Cleaner has many more options for customizing how the plugin works. Plus, users who cannot afford an upgrade can always run the free version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not to say either is better or worse than the other. Both were solid options in my tests. I just want to merge the best features from each, snagging the interface from Remove Unused Media and the configurability of Media Cleaner.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 01:31:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"Gutenberg Times: Gutenberg Adoption: Levels One through Five — Page Builder Summit, October 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?page_id=19119\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/gutenberg-adoption-levels-1-5-page-builder-summit-october-2021/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21135:\"<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Thank you for attending my talk at the Page Builder Summit! 💕</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow-up from the Page Builder Summit October 18 &#8211; 22, 2021 and the presentation: &#8220;<strong>Customizing WordPress Block Editor for Client Projects</strong>&#8221; by Birgit Pauli-Haack </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"toolbelt-video-wrapper\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Transcript</p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, hello everybody. Thank you all for inviting me to the Page Builder Summit. I&#8217;m honored to be here, and I can only hope that today&#8217;s topic will be valuable to you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My talk is about how you as an agency or freelancer can start adopting working with the block editor and provide your customers, content creators, a true what you see is what you get experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know we have been promised true vis-a-vig for the last 25 years. We have come closer and closer every five years. The tools and modern software development have really advanced. And I talk to many site owners, freelancers and consultants in the WebPress community, and there have been plenty of sites that still rely on the classic editor for a myriad of reasons. And 80% of our customer sites are still on the classic editor. So don&#8217;t feel bad, but it&#8217;s also always good to figure out what would I do if a customer would come and want to start using the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So should you consider migrating your building block enable site? You don&#8217;t need to know it all. You can start introducing only some features of the block editor without having to know ReactJS or even build a block. There are quite a few levels of expertise that I will show you where you don&#8217;t need any of the React or modern JavaScript to be successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I call them levels of expertise. So level one is style and control. Level two is create block patterns. Level three is adding block styles and variations. And then level four is creating custom blocks with ACF or other tools like genesis blocks or lazy blocks plugin. And then level five is create native customs, static or dynamic blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this talk was inspired by a conversation that I had with Victoria Ramirez on the Gutenberg Times YouTube channel about a year ago. And I modified it a little bit with adding a few things. And I have for all five levels I show you examples and resources, so you can kind of jump in wherever you think it&#8217;s possible for you. But I will also go a bit deeper into level one and level two, to give you a head start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We won&#8217;t have time for the rest. But I&#8217;ll share the resources because quite a few developers have gone the path before you, and they share very generously what they learned and what they found. So let&#8217;s dive in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So out of a box we heard in 2018 that any theme works with a block editor. And that is mostly still true today. Mid-2019 two client project managers within a few months of each other came to me and said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s just enable the block editor and see what happens our contact readers will figure it out. And we&#8217;ll just ask you to restrict the color selections to our brand colors.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you might know that there is actually a custom color option and one client wanted it to be removed and the other said, &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s see if it&#8217;s a problem first.&#8221; So those are the two different approaches. But they all said, okay, let&#8217;s just kind of keep the theme, adopt some brand colors and see where the block editor takes us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first step that we did was to, is the theme actually the theme block editor compatible. And for that, we developed a test that&#8217;s not rocket science. We create a page with all the blocks and see how they look. And then we evaluate the amount of styling that is needed. And we share our test site as code in the gist that&#8217;s kind of linked in the slides. There are also linked to the instructions if you need more of them. And yeah, just so the bit.ly/pagebuilder1021 is actually the link to the slide deck if you want to follow along or use other links that I share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with this, we tested our theme. The theme just looks something like this. Yeah. With some blocks in there. And also some additional attributes. But I&#8217;m going to show you how that looked in just a normal theme. First, I just tested it in the starter theme underscore. And so that&#8217;s graded by automatic and has been a starter theme for many, many classic themes in this space. And I&#8217;m click you on that video and it gives you&#8230; So it&#8217;s a sample test and we scroll through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have added the test page and then we scroll through and see how things work or how things don&#8217;t work. And for this one, it seems fairly well adoptable. So if you, as freelancers have used underscore and didn&#8217;t change a whole lot, except the styling of course, and added a few things you should be fine with the block editor out of the box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I also tested it with the Naked WordPress starter theme by Josh Beckman. It&#8217;s a little bit dated, but it has a few more opinionated stylings already. So when we click on the same video again, you see, okay, the page looks a little bit different but in essence, and we see there are some line height issues that we would need to change. There are also some justification issues. But nothing really that is earth shattering or that would take a lot of time to fix. Well the drop caps there, you could disable that if you wanted to. And that even though the table with the stripes came through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that was easy. Well, let&#8217;s test one more. I had a client recently, he approached us because their are mobile ranking is very, very bad. So I tested the theme and that&#8217;s a theme from 2007. That&#8217;s 14 years old. And I just created a page with my blocks and you see it has some line height issues here but we can take care of that. Even the quote comes through with the background image, the buttons have round the corners and the columns look nice. We have a few distance issues there. They&#8217;re not as generous with white spaces, other themes are. But nothing earth shattering even there. So that should get you started and make your clients and yourself feel much better about using the block editor on an existing site and not have to do too many adjustments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you want to add a custom color palette then you would need to do two things depending on which version of WordPress you are on. So having a color palette, that means the colors that are in the side bar of the block editor for maybe a paragraph block or the background image and the text color that&#8217;s where your custom palette would go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So depending on which version on WordPress you are. For WordPress 5.7 or older, 5.6, 5.5, you had a two step there. One is to put in the functions, PHP, add the theme support for editor color palette, and add an array of your colors with the name, the slug and the hexadecimal representation of the color. And then you will need to go to your style sheet and add for each color two more classes like has black color and has black background color.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you had three places to when you want to change your color, for instance here to modify. Starting with WebPress 5.8 or higher there&#8217;s&#8230; You probably heard that the theme json file was introduced and there was actually introduced for themes that prepare for full-site editing. But guess what? The theme json works also for classic themes. And you could use all the advantages of that for your classic themes when you start out and have it all in one configuration file. So there, you only would need to put in the json file, the settings and then the color, and then the palette with names, slogan, the color and hexadecimal, but you would not need to do the updates in your style sheet because the block editor is styling that out of the box. So you only need to set the palette and then the rest will be handled automatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, there was this one little thing where you have colors for background and text color. You also have these custom color link that opens up a little window where your user could change any color or add any color that is in that color picker. If you want your, or the customer decides to adhere just to the brand colors. You can remove that either by theme support and disable underscore custom, underscore colors. Or in the theme json you have the settings and then the color and the set the custom to false. So these are few for the custom colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at the text fonts. You could also do a custom font sizes. Right now the topography selection for paragraph has font sizes with small, medium, large, huge. And in the theme json you can set the pixel sizes for that, but with the custom font size the content creator could change. If you don&#8217;t want that, if you want to disable that you just use in the theme json typography, and then custom font size and set that to false.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s kind of a glimpse into how you can just change the configuration of the block editor, add custom colors, add custom font sizes to it and add some styling. And you are golden there. You haven&#8217;t touched any JavaScript, maybe just a little bit your functions PHP. But that wouldn&#8217;t be the first time that you tweak the theme with through functions and filters in the functions PHP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next level I want to discuss with you is our block patterns. They are a complete game changer for Gutenberg now that they&#8217;re introduced. They help content creators to use a set combination of core blocks and reproduce a wanted design and section over and over. That could be testimonials or a price list or a header pattern. So you could check out the pattern directory at wordpress.org/pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So sometimes I get the question because some of the early users of the block editor were very taken by the concept of reusable blocks and have used reusable blocks actually like block pattern, because there was nothing available with that. But block patterns are the opposite of reusable blocks. So reusable block is you will use on various places the identical block including the content and you could use it on every page or on 15 blog posts. And when you change the content, it changes every single instance of the block. And so you only have to change it once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, block pattern is, as I said, the collection of core blocks that you can add to your candles and then adjust to your needs. But the previous instances of the black pattern stay the same. So just because you modify a black pattern, now the tenth, you will not change previous instances of that. The block pattern directory is right now in version one, one where you can copy paste of patterns from the directory into your editor. Soon there is also a way to submit that&#8217;s designers submit patterns to the directory. Right now they are 84 that are with a design team together and outside designers of course. But they tested also how to translate them and how it all functions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So version two is coming soon. I just wanted to show you a few more examples of the block patterns that you find in the directory, because it also shows what you can do with them. So the next one. This is a team page kind of pattern, where you have your team member with a profile picture, the name, and the title. And underneath if you want a group of social links and that is repeated in a three-column layout. That&#8217;s just beautiful and depending on how the images are that you use for the profile, you can switch out every part of that once you put it into your block editor. Then also a testimonial is there with a little picture there, the testimonial and then the name of the person who said it. And then there is another beautiful header pattern. So check it out. It&#8217;s wordpress.org/pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next part is that you could actually create custom block patterns if you have sections in your new website or an existing website that needs to have the same layout over and over. We have that on our website that called impact stories. We have media and text pattern, one with a picture on the left and the other one with the picture on the right. And then we have a header, a paragraph, and a smaller citation, which organization that is. But there were also some attributes with the media text where we said okay, adopt the size of the picture, apply that background and apply it completely and have these kind of spaces left and right around the text. You can register a category and then register a block pattern that fits into the category. You don&#8217;t have to have a certain category. But you see it&#8217;s only a four attributes kind of array. It&#8217;s in PHP so it goes into your function, PHP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need a title, you need a description, the category is optional, and then the content. And when you see the content it&#8217;s not quite displayed here well. But you see it starts with a block comment with the attributes in the curly brackets. And that is so you can&#8230; And when you grab a pattern from the directory and click the copy and paste that into here, then it would be a new register block pattern for your site. It&#8217;s quite interesting to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are also plugins available for content creators to create custom patterns without using code. So Marcus Kazmierczak created one just recently called templates, which allows you to actually store your block pattern as a custom post type and then bring it in into your block editor. Jean Baptist Audras also added a block pattern featured to his reusable block, extended plugin, and in EditorsKit by Extendify, that was first built by Jeffrey Carandang and then taken over by Extendify a few months ago. There is a huge selection of patterns and page layouts that you can use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t have enough creative inspiration, there are also quite a few themes now that offer a great selection of block pattern. I think Anders Noren tweeted the other day and said, &#8220;When is it enough to ship the theme after 40 block patterns?&#8221; So his full-site editing so you can&#8217;t just install it as a classic theme. But if you put it up on a test site and add the Gutenberg plugin to it, you can test his theme Tove. That&#8217;s the new one. And Ellen Bauer from Elma Studio also has a new theme, it&#8217;s called Aino. And Carolina Nymark and the Theme team build the Twenty Twenty One theme also as a block-based theme. And they also have quite a few block patterns that you want to consult and see how they work. So you can replicate something for your clients there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the resource list for block patterns. There&#8217;s a big resource list on the Gutenberg Times. Then there is developer handbook docs on&#8230; Sorry, the developer handbook on patterns. And then Justin Tadlock on WPTavern has a post on block patterns will change everything. And so that concludes our level two of&#8230; And see how far you already have come without touching any code but still create custom designs for your clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then on level three. Get to a little bit into more code. The level three is add block styles and variations. Adding block styles means there&#8217;s a few you more choices in the sidebar for a block, and can also be selected as a default style and variations show up a bit more elaborate in creation and can be found in core for instance for the social icons block or layout elements for different buttons that&#8217;s from one of the tutorials out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with the documented block filters you can also add custom attribution and additional functionality that how plugins extend the core blocks. So here are a few more block styles that I found in the wild. Here are two for columns where there&#8217;s a style not to use any gutters or horizontal separators. And this is a style for the for list block here with check marks and then block styles for an image where you can&#8230; The rounded is coming with core but then one plugin also had the bottom wave and the top wave for the images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To dive in a little bit deeper into block variations. So they&#8217;re more elaborate rather than just styling. There&#8217;s also additional functionality in there. Like for the block variations for the core columns, you see for instance a two-column variation. A two column with a 50/50 split and a two column with a 30/70 split either way left or right. And then a three-column split with the same size or 25, 50. Those are variation that come in with the block into your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is an example from one of the tutorials where they had a one block that has some additional information about a portfolio. Like a page intro where they identify the client and the role of the organization with the freelancer on that particular project. And so they don&#8217;t have to design it every time when they add that to a block. They just can use their block variations for that. And you see in that little box here, that&#8217;s also coming through the inserter of the block here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the next slide, I have a few articles that dive deeper in those topics. As I said, we don&#8217;t have enough time here. But you will be able to kind of follow along on those. Yeah. With add custom size, a White Pixel is a great site to visit about Gutenberg blocks and development. Then there is the dev note when the block variations API was introduced into WordPress, then how to use block variation WordPress at the CSS-Trick site, extending Gutenberg blocks with custom attributes and controls by Jeffrey Carandang. And then the reference guide and a crash course on WebPress filters. So that should get you all started and successful on block styles, variation, and block filters. And that concludes the level three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next level is&#8230; Okay. So we needed to add data to it, like in a ACF and advanced custom fields or other plugins. We also not only manage content, but also data. If you think you need custom blocks and you&#8217;re not comfortable with ReactJS and modern JavaScript. These three plugins help you out in building custom blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, there&#8217;s also the parts framework, which just came out with version 2.8 with a block integration. There&#8217;s also a tool set that helps you create blocks. But the Advanced Custom Fields Pro, Genesis Custom Blocks, prior to that, it was called Block Lab, and the Lazy Blocks. I wrote an intro kind of comparison article for the WPTavern quite a while ago by might still get you started, or at least thinking of how to select which plugin to select and to work with it. If you are already a customer of Advanced Custom Fields, get the pro version and so you get also the building of the custom blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then level five is creating custom blocks with ReactJS. There&#8217;s plenty of getting started information available. The official scaffolding script create block creates everything that you need for a plugin with a single block and Ali Alaa and has a course on Udemy on Gutenberg blocks for WordPress and react developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is certainly also a build block series. Marcus Kazimierczak also has a short series. I think it&#8217;s seven steps or seven block posts. A White Pixel also has a tutorial series to create Gutenberg blocks to follow along. And then the Udemy block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we&#8217;re coming right about to the end of the talk. I just wanted to point out there is a Gutenberg Times live Q&amp;A happening on October 28th at 1600 UTC. That&#8217;s noon Eastern US. We call it case study for converting classic widgets to blocks for BuddyPress. So we will have a discussion with the team members of BuddyPress Mathieu Viet, David Cavins, and Varun Dubey will tell us how they transformed in very fast succession dozens of classic widgets in two blocks for the WordPress 5.8 release. They also will be there to answer your questions. Link is in the slide of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s all I have for you today. You can certainly stay in touch with me on the WordPress Slack or on Twitter with BPH. My DMs are open, or you can reach me via email at <a href=\"mailto:pauli@gutenbergtimes.com\">pauli@gutenbergtimes.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out our YouTube channel, youtube.com/gutenbergtimes where we posted all our previous live Q&amp;A over the last two years. And then every Saturday I send out a weekend edition of hand curated links from the community and from the Gutenberg development team. So you can keep up with Gutenberg. The slides, as I said, are available under https:/bit.ly.ay/pagebuilder1028. And that&#8217;s it. Thank you very much. And I&#8217;ll see you around the internet and in the community. Bye-bye.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 15:15:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Birgit Pauli-Haack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: Build Notification Banners With ElmaStudio’s Latest Block Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=124460\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:191:\"https://wptavern.com/build-notification-banners-with-elmastudios-latest-block-plugin?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=build-notification-banners-with-elmastudios-latest-block-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5840:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">A friend and I were discussing the need for more one-off block plugins earlier today. He had mentioned that WordPress has this powerful block search feature that rarely turns up anything useful. Most are part of collections that do not appear in the results. This was part of a more wide-ranging conversation that I am sure I will tackle on another day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it reminded me that I had a couple of ElmaStudio&rsquo;s block plugins sitting in the backlog along with some notes on them. The team released <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/aino-accordion-faq-block/\">Aino Accordion FAQ Block</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/aino-notification-block/\">Aino Notification Banner Block</a> three weeks ago. The latter piqued my interest more so than the former.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting an error notification.\n\n\n\n<p>The two-person team of Ellen Bauer and Manuel Esposito could have continued amassing a collection within their existing Aino Blocks plugin. Instead, they took a turn down the path few have traveled. They are now releasing single-purpose blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We plan to work on smaller add-on single blocks from now on as well,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/a-second-look-at-elmastudios-aino-theme-and-companion-block-plugin#comment-392898\">said Bauer in the comments</a> on my last <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/a-second-look-at-elmastudios-aino-theme-and-companion-block-plugin\">review of their theme and block library</a>. &ldquo;Blocks that are needed for building more complex block page templates.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notification boxes are so commonplace that you almost wonder why they are not a part of core WordPress. Many block collection plugins bundle one or multiple, but it is hard to find a solid solution as a single block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block has six statuses that users can select from:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Welcome</li><li>Info</li><li>Help</li><li>Success</li><li>Warning</li><li>Error</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Each status has its own icon and default colors. The colors are customizable, but the icon itself is not. I am a fan of the decision because it means one less choice I must make. There is also an option to hide the icon and switch between fill and outline versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Testing different notification statuses.\n\n\n\n<p>The block also displays a &ldquo;dismiss&rdquo; button for visitors to close the banner on the front end. The state is not saved, so if the visitor returns to the page, it will reappear. I would like to see an option to store the banner state in the browser in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like the plugin for its simplicity. The default output works well enough for most themes, but it has enough options for users to customize it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upcoming site editor is where the plugin could really shine. Of course, a user would need a block theme to use it there, such as ElmaStudio&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/aino/\">Aino</a>. The block offers a quick and easy way of plopping something like a sales banner across the top of the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding a sales banner at the top of the site.\n\n\n\n<p>I do have a few nit-picks, of course. These are not <em>OMGBBQ</em> problems that make the plugin unusable. Instead, they are places where it could be improved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because many themes use a top margin approach to vertical rhythm, it can disrupt the alignment of the icon and paragraph. The plugin should zero this out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If anyone else runs into this issue, the following CSS is a quick fix:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>.wp-block-ainoblocks-notification-block .content-wrapper p:first-of-type {\n    margin-top: 0;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the downsides to the plugin is its custom system for borders and padding. From a development perspective, I prefer the plugin&rsquo;s system under the hood, which uses a curated set of values that keep a user from doing something really crazy. It offers a balance between flexibility and rational choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />The plugin&rsquo;s custom controls.\n\n\n\n<p>I have argued that most design controls should have such a system &mdash; the same one that is in place for font sizes and colors &mdash; <em>ad nauseum</em>. However, Gutenberg and core have moved in a different direction, preferring arbitrary user-defined values over a range of presets. Plugin authors should fall in line for the sake of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a user, I prefer consistency. I want the interface to be the same, regardless of whether I am dealing with a core or third-party block. Having to learn multiple methods to add padding or change a border creates unnecessary friction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin&rsquo;s custom system also conflicts with default block styles that theme authors can define in their <code>theme.json</code> files. The standards set by WordPress create a bridge between plugins and themes that the platform has never had before. The more block developers follow it, the easier it is for theme designers to work within the system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other options. In the past week, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/alert-box-block/\">Alert Box Block</a> plugin landed in the directory. It provides far more icon options and more design controls in general. However, its UI is so different from the WordPress standard that I cannot imagine using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I talk about issues with Aino Notification Banner, it must be taken into context. I point out problems because I see its potential. I want the developers to continue iterating on it, improving what is already one of the best options out there. This is something that ElmaStudio has proven it can do with earlier projects, so I look forward to what the plugin looks like in the future. For now, it is a solid option for users who need to display notification boxes.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 00:08:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg Contributors Propose Renaming Reusable Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=123800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:175:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-contributors-propose-renaming-reusable-blocks?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gutenberg-contributors-propose-renaming-reusable-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4106:\"<p>WordPress&rsquo; Reusable blocks may soon be <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/34352\">getting re-named</a>, as the feature&rsquo;s distinct capabilities are less recognizable from its name following the introduction of patterns. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Gutenberg project first took off, nobody had any idea how important patterns would become in the page building experience, or that they would be getting their own directory on WordPress.org. During a demo at WordCamp Europe 2021, Gutenberg lead architect Mat&iacute;as Ventura commented on how transformative patterns have been for making page design approachable for users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was a smaller part of the roadmap initially but it&rsquo;s becoming a centerpiece &ndash; especially because it allows&hellip;world class designers to provide a starting point for users and users get to learn design as they are interacting with themes,&rdquo; Ventura said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year later, patterns have made their way to the forefront of theme design and development with an excitement that rivals <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2006/02/25/wordpress-widgets/\">the introduction of widgets</a> in WordPress&rsquo; earlier days. WordPress 5.9 will feature <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/31153\">pattern insertion</a> directly from the Pattern Directory so users will be able to change their patterns as often as they like, without having to switch themes. Coming in Gutenberg 11.8, the pattern inserter will <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35115\">highlight featured patterns from the directory</a> in the initial view, instead of displaying the first alphabetical category. Contributors are also considering a path for allowing themes to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/35364\">surface specific patterns from the directory</a> instead of bundling them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In light of all this activity around Patterns, Reusable blocks are in need of a renaming that is more descriptive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;In the end, patterns are also&nbsp;<em>reusable</em>&nbsp;pieces of design,&rdquo; Ventura said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Given the nature of these [Reusable] blocks is to have content in sync wherever it&rsquo;s displayed &mdash; edit once; update everywhere &mdash; I propose we change the name in the UI to &lsquo;Synced Blocks&rsquo; and adjust the block description a little bit to clarify that.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UI for Reusable Blocks is confusing because it is built on top of assumptions that users know the intricacies of how they work. WordPress developer Lee Hodson <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/31163#issuecomment-898376830\">summarized the problem</a> and how the current UI leads to reusable blocks being accidentally edited:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The save reusable blocks dialog is nice but how many creators actually understand what this save dialog means? On the surface it looks as though everyone should understand the save/not save option but it&rsquo;s meaning is only obvious when you understand that reusable blocks are (currently) meant to either (a) not be edited or (b) edits to them are meant to affect all instances of the same block and (c) that reusable blocks can be converted to editable blocks (and not everyone immediately understands the difference) when edits to reusable blocks are meant to be independent of the block&rsquo;s template.</p><p>I feel that a nice idea (reusable blocks) has been very badly implemented and many creators are blissfully unaware of its pitfalls until they realize their &lsquo;template blocks&rsquo; have been overwritten.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Several contributors participating in the renaming discussion concurred that &ldquo;Synced Blocks&rdquo; would be a better name for the feature. This suggestion is the frontrunner so far. The conversation is still open and consideration of this proposal has been added to the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/27890\">Reusable Blocks Improvements</a> tracking issue.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 21:50:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 18: The Economics of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=11351\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/10/episode-18-the-economics-of-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20740:\"<p>In episode 18 of WP Briefing, Josepha Haden Chomphosy reflects on a recent lecture that she gave to students at Hendrix College in which she explored the economics of WordPress and the principles that sustain the project&#8217;s ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

I&#8217;m your host, Joseph Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today marks the start of Digital Citizenship week. This year in 2021, it is the week of October 18th, and to kick it off, I want to share with you a bit of a lecture that I gave to a college class last week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:55</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An economics professor teaches this class. And so, a little bit, I went to talk about how WordPress is essentially a microcosm of global societies. That was mostly why I was invited to come and give the talk. But one of the students asked a really interesting question about economics, and especially the economics of WordPress. And so, I&#8217;m going to take some time to do my best to answer that question here as well. But first, we&#8217;re going to start with some big picture information about WordPress that I shared with the students, and then maybe you also don&#8217;t necessarily know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first place that we started was with the question of what WordPress is. Most of them had heard of it but didn&#8217;t necessarily have a good handle on what it is. And so this is the definition that I gave to them. This is a bit of each of the facets of WordPress that we kind of see right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, WordPress is, of course, a content management system, which means it&#8217;s a piece of software that uses a copyleft license, which means that it&#8217;s open source, and no one individual necessarily owns the rights to the code. If you get very specific, WordPress is, of course, a FOSS project or a free and open source software project. I know that there are discussions around when a piece of software is free, then what are you using to pay for that piece of software or to pay for your access to that software? And often, the answer is that you&#8217;re using your personally identifying information to pay for something commonly referred to as the data economy. If you&#8217;re not familiar with that, it&#8217;s a little bit of a three-pronged effort there. So you submit your data to get access to the software, or you can join the platform, depending on what it is that you&#8217;re working with. That platform or that software collects your data so that they can build a profile about what sorts of content engages you and so that they can share, essentially, audience cohorts like groups of people that kind of are talking about what you&#8217;re talking about, agree with what you agree about, and find interesting, the same sorts of things that you find interesting. And then those companies sell access to your attention. This is something that I refer to as the attention economy. I think there are a lot of startups at the moment that refers to the attention economy. The most iconic recent example was when the folks over at Netflix said that they weren&#8217;t competing against other streaming services; they were competing against sleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that might ring true for quite a few of us at the moment. But anyway, to scoot us back one level, I had, as I said, WordPress is free software. But the difference with WordPress is that to get a copy of WordPress, you are not necessarily required to hand over any data. You don&#8217;t need to give anyone data to get a copy. You don&#8217;t need to give anyone money or data to open up a copy that you own or to build a website in it if you&#8217;re just doing it locally, but especially around that data side because WordPress is not collecting any data, we&#8217;re also not brokering access to anyone&#8217;s attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another answer to the question of &#8220;What is WordPress?&#8221; WordPress software and the project enable nearly half a trillion dollars of revenue in the global digital economy, as we learned from a recent study from one of the hosting companies inside the WordPress project&nbsp; &#8211; oh, Inside the WordPress ecosystem anyway. And WordPress also runs 42% of the web, with some of the biggest sites we know using WordPress. Such sites like the New York Times, Rolling Stone, many, many others, which you can see in the WordPress showcase as well. I don&#8217;t necessarily want to just like call out all the big groups that use it. But it&#8217;s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;To recap what we just learned about WordPress and what WordPress is. It is software that one uses a copyleft license, meaning no single entity owns it. Two, it is available at no cost, meaning no money changes hands for you to own a copy. Three does not track you, which means that you don&#8217;t have to give WordPress any personally identifying information to get a copy. Four is an enabler of a massive digital economy massive portion of the digital economy even. That, you know, means their services, extensions, themes, plugins, all of that stuff. And five, it is software that supports 42% of the web. Practically every other site you visit uses the software. So that&#8217;s WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this massive free software, you might be thinking to yourself a couple of things. The first thing you might be thinking is, &#8220;Well, that sounds impossible.&#8221; But if that&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re thinking, you may be thinking, &#8220;how is it possible that a software that is technically owned by no one and takes no money or data to obtain &#8211;&nbsp; how is it that a software like that can power 42% of the web.&#8221; This brings me, of course, to a topic that I specialize in, which is how WordPress is made.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is, by now you know, built by a global community of contributors. And it&#8217;s partially contributors that are self-sponsored or giving of their own time freely, and partly sponsored volunteers, people who are paid by Five for the Future initiatives inside various companies. I have said many times, most recently at WordCamp US, that I have an ideal ratio of about two to one in that kind of volunteer or self-sponsored versus corporately sponsored set of voices. And also, as I said, at WordCamp US, we’re not necessarily getting to that ideal ratio right now because of the nature of the way the world is at the moment. However, this community functions almost like a tiny little digital society. There are ways to get your voice heard ways to take on leadership roles; there is a little bit of light governmental structure. And as with any society, any community like this, there&#8217;s a relationship inherent there. There&#8217;s almost a transactional element that takes place when you&#8217;re participating fully. Although I know that for the WordPress project, especially for open source in general, there is a reminder that we should always be contributing without the expectation of reciprocity. But even if you are contributing without the expectation of reciprocity, you still are engaging in an existing community, which means that you are fostering a relationship with the community or with the people who are also participating in the community with you. It&#8217;s just inescapable if you have people around and working together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So two concepts really informed my work to future-proof the WordPress project. And the first one is digital citizenship, which is why this particular WordPress Briefing fits today. And the other is the Tragedy of the Commons, especially how we go about refreshing those commons. So digital citizenship, I talked about it a bit in the last WP Briefing. But it&#8217;s still true today that that&#8217;s important. And the thing that really matters to me as we are working through how to make sure that WordPress is moving forward together. But most discussions of citizenship are location-specific, which makes plenty of sense. However, with so many mobile devices and broader access to some level of internet, we have increasing opportunities to be connected because of interests or skill sets. And even the things that we aspire to or aspire to be with a community like WordPress, which has no home office or main location. Of course, it&#8217;s very important that all of the leaders in WordPress, all of the team reps in WordPress, are proactively engaging with the people in their teams and in their portions of the community instead of waiting for like happenstance running into people. We also use a bunch of social stuff to get people together: twitch screams, not twitch screams because it&#8217;s not that Halloweeny! Twitch streams, hallway hangouts, events that are both online and off. Everything that the Learn section of the community is doing with their discussion groups. There are so many ways that WordPress proactively engages with each other and engages with itself. And that work is all really important to keeping the community involved, which is key to any organization&#8217;s long-term success, and certainly is true for WordPress as long-term success. Because when your community or your organization or your society is engaged and invested in your collective success, then you are (get ready for a list) one, more likely to see obstacles early and be able to overcome them, two more likely to see upcoming trends and prepare for them, three more likely to see what is broken and be able to repair it before it is a major issue. And four, you are more likely to be a resilient and fruitful organization long after any single member has stopped participating.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>11:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more connected to the community you are and the more active, the greater your influence and the ability to affect changes also become. And so, not only is it important for us to remain connected as a community just to make sure that everything is going well. But also, it&#8217;s one of the primary ways that people who are giving back can sort of have more of an opportunity in this particular ecosystem. In open source, anyone can gain influence by helping others by helping the software and by keeping the trains on the tracks. And so, one of the only lasting limits to long-term potential in an open source project is how good you are at seeing beyond yourself and seeing what good action can make beyond just your own benefits. I understand that there are also specific hurdles to contribution in your free time that I have dedicated a couple of different podcasts to, so I don&#8217;t want to neglect that reality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have found in my experience that one of the limiting factors that sometimes cannot be unlearned is not being able to see kind of a broader scope, a broader perspective than what you&#8217;re already bringing into it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So being a good digital citizen, that&#8217;s a really important part of keeping any society together any organization together and moving forward. But especially is in the context of digital citizenship, is true for WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:48</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that is really important to me is this concept of the Tragedy of the Commons, which is, of course, an economics term, open source has borrowed. We have talked about it in this podcast in the past. And today, I specifically am talking about how WordPress works to consistently be refreshing the commons. So the theory of the Tragedy of the Commons says that all societies can withstand a certain volume of free-riders. A certain number of people who reap the benefits of that community’s society without necessarily putting anything back into it. And that is no different in open source than in any other place where you would apply this concept. The particular catch for WordPress is of course, that it is free, freely available and has no specific copyright holder. And so in those circumstances, it is incredibly easy for a small group of people to maintain the software while the whole world uses it for free. And not only is it possible for a small group of people to maintain it, but if you&#8217;re not careful, it&#8217;s also easy for a small group of unpaid people and unacknowledged people to maintain something forever. And at the volume that WordPress operates at, that&#8217;s a really risky choice. It doesn&#8217;t help to support those people; it puts the long-term stability of the software in jeopardy. And at the end of the day, it just does not help to replenish the commons to make sure that everybody keeps getting to have the benefits of this ecosystem in the long term.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>14:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As many of you know, there is this program called Five for the Future. And that program is essentially modeled after a tithe. So the invitation to this program when it was first introduced in 2014 was that if you or your company or your community is made better or made possible by WordPress, you should give back to the WordPress project 5% of your resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is an aspirational 5%, of course, and some groups give back their time while others give back with their money. But almost anyone who wants to give back has some skill that WordPress needs. That particular program has really grown in leaps and bounds since it was introduced. I don&#8217;t know exactly how many team members were considered Five for the Future contributors when it was first introduced in 2014; it was a little before my time. But at the moment, it&#8217;s about 150 people that I am routinely aware of or in contact with, which is still a small number considering how many people use WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, many corporations who have seen the most benefit, including, you know, the company that I work for (Automattic), and a lot of other hosting companies in the ecosystem, all do a really good job of refreshing the commons so that WordPress is still usable for businesses of all levels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>16:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to leave us with one final big picture thought about open source. This is going to be a callback to one of my earliest episodes in this podcast. But I think that it&#8217;s always worth remembering. We&#8217;re going to talk about this really popular phrase in open source projects &#8220;free as in speech, not free as in beer.&#8221; And for WordPress, as you know, it&#8217;s a little bit of both. It&#8217;s literally free. But also, since it&#8217;s open source, it has a free as in speech component to it as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>16:46</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The four freedoms of open source as laid out in the 90s. So 10 years into the open source movement, are basically that you have the freedom to run the program for any purpose, the freedom to study how the program works, and change it so that it can do your computing as you wish, the freedom to redistribute copies so that you can help your neighbor and the freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions, giving the community a chance to learn and benefit from the changes that you put into the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>17:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t remember if I said this in my original podcast, but I&#8217;m going to say it today, free speech has a lot of responsibility, just like being a part of a community. Governments or communities, or in our case, this software is built by the people who show up. For WordPress at 42% of the web, every small choice we make can cause huge changes in how people experience the web today and tomorrow. And that, to my mind, is really no different than participating in any sort of civic infrastructure. The changes that are made today, or the errors that we prevent, set the tone and the circumstance and the potential to thrive for everyone who comes after us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>18:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That leads us into our smallest of big things. I just have a couple of things for you all today. Firstly, at the time of this recording, this is prior to the Go/No-Go demo meeting for WordPress 5.9. So I have no idea what&#8217;s happened. But by the time this podcast has been released, we will have had the Go/No-Go meeting and also have shipped the post that summarizes what happened, what we hope to change in the next essentially sprint so that we can confidently move forward with a clear set of features for the 5.9 release. I will include a link to the notes below in the show notes. Kudos to everyone, props to everyone who participated in that meeting. And also props to all the people who have been helping us as we head into this final release of the year and all of you who are going to help us make it successfully to the end.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>19:15</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing I already kind of alluded to at the top of the podcast, it is Digital Citizenship week; two or three years ago, the WordPress blog had a series about digital citizenship and what it means to be a good digital citizen, what it means to do that in the context of WordPress. I will drop a link to those posts in the show notes as well. They are very well written and very important, and fairly evergreen content.

In today&#8217;s episode we will talk about so much, WordPress 5.9 go/no go decision, Gutenberg releases 11.6 and 11.7 and ongoing discussions on themes and styles and editors and everything.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and WordPress developer advocate, sponsored by Automattic. I&#8217;m here with my co-host, Grzegorz Ziółkowski, code wrangler at Automattic and WordPress core contributor. How are you, Grzegorz? How are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I&#8217;m great. I had a blast during my vacation. I want to tell you more about it, but we have so much to cover today that there isn&#8217;t much time for chit-chat. How have you been lately, Birgit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Well, I had a blast running live Q&amp;As this week and last week and the week after next and talking to developers and users. You&#8217;re right, let&#8217;s catch up after the show and let&#8217;s get this started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowsk</em>i: Yay. Before we start we want to thank you, Jorge Calle user name, AtrumGeost from Ecuador for his five-star review.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Hooray. We are so thrilled to have you as our listener. Jorge wrote, “the best all-the-things Gutenberg podcast. This is my favorite Gutenberg and WP-related podcast. It helps me keep up-to-date with all the new and upcoming changes and to understand the reason behind those changes.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s so nice. That&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;re trying to do. Thank you, Jorge. Greetings to Ecuador.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, we could put that as our mission. Yes, greetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yes. All right, we have a few announcements because it&#8217;s been a while. The next live Q&amp;A, put this on your calendar, is a discussion with the BuddyPress team on how they converted classic widgets into blocks. We learn what was hard and got easier over the first two times I did it. Join us on October 28th at noon Eastern, 1600 UTC with Mathieu Viet, David Cavins and Varun Dubey on the live Q&amp;A show. It&#8217;s going to be really, really interesting, especially for developers who still are a little bit on the edge to jump into Gutenberg development, also theme developers who have widgets in their themes. It&#8217;s definitely going to be educational because we will have some demos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, I guess it should be also useful for the developers who have plug-ins and they still waited to convert them to blocks because it&#8217;s all about that, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Right, right. Everything needs to be a block now. It&#8217;s just so much better for the users to use them because everything&#8217;s just one concept, they don&#8217;t have to do the mystery meet with what are widgets, what are menus, what are sidebar and all this kind of thing. Yeah, speaking of live Q&amp;As, yesterday I had the privilege to host a discussion among WordPress giants, Mark Jaquith, core committer for 17 years, Helen Hou-Sandi working on WordPress for 10 years and Riad Benguella who is the newbie in that regard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: A rookie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: He&#8217;s already working on Gutenberg for even five or even seven years, so &#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Five. Five.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Five years. They discussed how can we make building blocks easier. It was a follow up on a Twitter thread Mark started with a question, what if building custom blocks for the block editor was as easy as supplying attributes and a block of HTML? What if this produced react editing code and PHP rendering code without a build stack? Coincidentally enough, he and Riad independently of each other were exploring some technical avenues for that and Helen was too. Grzegorz, you know more about the technical framework and underpinnings of Gutenberg, what was your take from the discussion yesterday?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I was really excited to see this discussion happening in the forum where people have more time to express their ideas, where they come from, what&#8217;s their use case and how they arrived at similar conclusions which is the best part of that. All three people, they were working on different aspects. Riad is working only on core, mostly on core and Helen is doing work for customers, same as Mark. Basically different venues came to the same conclusions. It&#8217;s really nice that we have good understanding where it should all go now. Those ideas that they both shared are pretty decent and I guess this is something that should be materialized in the future. That should greatly benefit all the developers that increase blocks on a daily basis. It was really cool and I encourage everyone who is doing block development to catch up with this discussion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also check the references they mentioned. One is from Riad, it&#8217;s on his GitHub, it&#8217;s called Block, we will provide links. Mark, he also has the same idea, I believe it&#8217;s called Blocksta, the code name. Yeah, that&#8217;s really insightful from my perspective. I learned a lot, especially about the background, all the friction people have and the pain points. It&#8217;s something that, as a core team member, I heard a lot about that, but it was more on the side of showing what&#8217;s wrong and not necessarily what are the challenges people have on a daily basis that end up with all the frustration they share, which is very limited, especially on Twitter which is a few characters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah. I also like that both Mark and Helen expressed and emphasized that the ideas that they had on how to do some templating and all that would not have been possible from the beginning because you need some underpinnings already working and some expansion of the API. Mark mentioned the block API version two where PHP and JavaScript have the same information about blocks, that was necessary to actually even think about any of the additional helper function, tool function for block editing and block writing or building. They also expressed that it shouldn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s not necessarily something that needs to be in core, but it could be one of the official tool building for plug-in developers. Yeah, it was a really good discussion. I will also share in the show notes Helen Hou-Sandi&#8217;s blog post called exploring custom blocks from a PHP-centric developer UX point of view where she even more elaborated on where she was coming from from the agency work there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>WordPress 5.9 Go/No Go Decision</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, definitely. I could continue on this topic for long, but let&#8217;s go to the most important announcement of the day which is the go/no go decisions. The meeting happened yesterday. The official post isn&#8217;t ready yet. Yesterday will be October 14. We spoke with Matias and Hector Pietro who attended the meeting. It looks like all the features discussed during this session should be included in the WordPress 5.9 release which means that block themes will be supported as an option with how they call it, a remark that there will be something like early access or something along those lines just to build proper expectations for users. At the same time it&#8217;s worth to mention that the new Twenty Twenty-Two theme built out of the blocks will ship with WordPress. Therefore, the default experience with themes for all new websites will start with blocks. I think it&#8217;s huge and super exciting to see it happening finally. They took so much time, but there is more. Do you want to say something about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Well, I just wanted to notice that the theme Twenty Twenty-Two was actually introduced last week by Kjell Reigstad and he&#8217;s working with Jeff Ong on it. We will share, of course, the link in the show notes, but if you want to check it out it&#8217;s on the design, actually on the core make blog, very buried but it&#8217;s beautiful. He also has some ways how he can change the theme.json and then make the theme a total different look than what he&#8217;s originally planned there. It&#8217;s really nice. You had more to say about the go/no go from Matías Ventura?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. No, you sidetracked my brain now for the Twenty Twenty-Two theme. It&#8217;s really beautiful. I really admire the work done with that, especially because it was very challenging on the technical level. We had to build all the blocks to make that happen but the outcome is really good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also would like to bring to your attention the issue that was created today by Matías which contains a series of bugs and shortcomings that he faced during preparation for this 5.9 go/no go decisions meeting. We will share a link to the issue which has the number 35662. It only confirms that there aren&#8217;t any significant bugs that put too much risk on the roll-out plan, however it will be essential to sort out those minor issues because they might negatively impact the first user impression. One more thing to mention is that you all will be able to watch the progress of the release execution in the traditional way which is through the issue, through the project board which is Gutenberg and the name is WordPress 5.9 must-haves. The project number is 62.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. Thank you for the summary there. There&#8217;s actually a video that you can, it was a one-hour meeting and they recorded it, it&#8217;s available on WordPress.TV. I wanted to go still for those who &#8230; the plan, the schedule of the release. Feature freeze will be November 9th, that&#8217;s 42 days after go/no go. From today on it&#8217;s 41 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Or even 40 because the meeting was postponed by one day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Oh right. Right, right. It&#8217;s actually 39. Beta one will be released or is scheduled to be released November 16th and then the release candidate one is scheduled to be released on November 30th. The final release is scheduled for December 14th, 2021 and will have, from the Gutenberg plug-in releases, the latest one will be 11.9, all the versions from 11, or 10.8, or 11.0 I think to 11.9, release candidate. 11.8 will still be a normal release on Gutenberg plug-in and then 11.9, the release candidate, the features that are in there will be then merged with core and then bug fixing starts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just also want to mention that before the go/no go meeting the group working on the navigation block and editor screen, navigation editor screen held a hallway hangout so to speak. Among other things they concluded that the navigation editor screen itself is not ready for 5.9. Only the navigation block and the block for new navigation and I think it has some &#8230; I don&#8217;t think it has a feature for existing menus, so we need to see about that, the main reason why they won&#8217;t solve the underlying backwards compatibility issues successfully before the release. A menu is a major part of a website. There are a myriad of third-party products tapping into the current features and they all need to be accommodated in one way or another.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a summary post about that on the core blog, we&#8217;ll share the links of course and there&#8217;s also a video where you can also follow along on the meeting. We will share all the relevant links for the 5.9 at the current stage in our show notes, that&#8217;s a summary post of the meeting, Matías&#8217;s roadmap, Josepha&#8217;s planning post and then the meeting recording as well as the summary post by Hector Pietro. That&#8217;s about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. Just to summarize, the navigation block is going to be included, right? It&#8217;s crucial to have it for the block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yes. Yes, but they were still trying to figure out if they need a second block for the backwards compatibility or they want to put it all in one block. They concluded now that they don&#8217;t want to burden the new feature, the new navigation block with the legacy part from 18 years of WordPress development so they are working on a second block that is the compatibility, that handles the compatibility issues. Also, some of the plug-ins actually tap into the navigation editor screen as well and the customizer so there are so many different branches of what to think about that they said, okay, we need to take a step back and see that we&#8217;re not making the same mistake that happened with the widget editor where they weren&#8217;t having enough tests with the third-party plug-ins to get this out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s about the release. I&#8217;m totally excited about it, especially because of the block theme with the full site editing. We will have some new or old terms. I think we were always talking about the block-based theme, it&#8217;s now called block theme. We were talking about the site editor, or template editor, now it&#8217;s the editor. We were talking about the global styles, they&#8217;re just the styles because, yeah, that&#8217;s all there is. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Everything gets simplified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Simplicity is to aim for, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Even the user experience that the blocks provide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah, and….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Okay. Let&#8217;s move to another point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Move on. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>WordCamp US 2021</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. WordCamp US, I didn&#8217;t watch it live, I watched some talks afterwards. How about you, Birgit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: I watched it live. I took the day off from other work so I could really concentrate on that. My favorite talks were, I couldn&#8217;t decide on the favorite so I have three favorite talks. One was from Rich Tabor from Extendify, his talk was building modern WordPress sites, the interplay of blocks, pattern and theme.json. That&#8217;s definitely a very good presentation to watch, not only because all his slides were so beautiful and his voice was so soothing, we were all very relaxed about all the new things that come to WordPress, but he also made very clear how all these things work together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I saw also that some people were confused whether it&#8217;s an advertisement for WordPress or is it an actual talk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Then the other one was a voice for the new White House Administration with the block editor by Helen Hou-Sandi. It was an hour-long presentation but it had a few different parts in there. One was making clear the advantages between a form-based content collection screen to the what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor and how they accomplish that. They actually built custom blocks, they did that for the experience. Then Helen, in the second part of it she also went in and explained why native blocks, Gutenberg blocks are so important. Then went on to actually show how she coded one of them and made the difference between the different, showed the difference between the approaches that they were exploring and where they finally settled. She has actually some code examples in there and she walked us through her set-up. That was really good. There was a lot of things packed in there, but it was one whole presentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the last one was Kjell Reigstad who showed us creative uses of block styles. Block styles is something that you use the core block, but you add additional CSS to it. That&#8217;s pretty much what block styles are. He showed how to do this, he also shared his repository, but he did all kinds of different graphical and animation. It was just beautiful to see what is all possible with just using block styles. You don&#8217;t have to do a whole lot of programming from that, at least not in JavaScript or in PHP, you need to do a lot of CSS for that. A lot of designers know that part and I think it&#8217;s a good starting point to get your creative juices going. Yeah, how about you? What did you watch on the rerun?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I watched all the talks you mentioned so you took my picks. Anyway, I have one more to share, the one from Cory Webb, software engineer at Fast. He had a talk named the demystifying Gutenberg blocks, understanding first steps to becoming a Gutenberg developer. I really liked the talk because it was structured in a very nice way. It covered all the APIs, basic APIs you need to know to start with blocks, but he also added a section where it was nice to know and there&#8217;s some additional going further if you want to extend your knowledge base and there are some other topics. That&#8217;s a good way of approaching that and it will be super beneficial for anyone who either already started working with blocks or they want to start because it covers all the levels when you want to become a master going from the beginner and scaling your knowledge. I liked that about this talk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. If you watched that you have all the pieces that you need to go from beginner to experienced. That&#8217;s also a part of my talk that will be shown at the Page Builder Summit that starts on Monday from Nathan Wrigley and Ann le Roux. There are a lot of talks there on the professional use of page builders in all areas. Ann is doing her full site editing talk and I&#8217;m going to talk about how to customize blocks for client projects. If you missed it, last week was also a theme developer live Q&amp;A. Ellen Bauer, Anders Norén and Carolina Nymark were on the show. Anders showed his block theme, Tove, and Ellen Bauer showed her studios theme, Aino, as a hybrid theme. I loved their excitement about the new possibilities of themes and blocks and full-site editing. They also shared how they made the journey from building classic themes to going block themes now. They also answered a ton of questions from the audience. The recording is available on YouTube and we will try and post a transcript and resources on the Gutenberg Times next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I started listening to this live Q&amp;A as well, it was pretty good, but I was driving so I couldn&#8217;t show the demo so I stopped. I didn&#8217;t have to time to go back, but I definitely have to. One thing that caught my attention was that Anders mentioned that one of the users of his team, he applied a lot of modification using styles and similar things. He sent a link to show the end effect. Anders said that he didn&#8217;t recognize this theme, he couldn&#8217;t say it was his. That&#8217;s a great thing about the future of building themes, the user will be so much empowered to achieve their goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Right. Yes. Yeah. Speaking about themes, there is a new site out there called wpblockpatterns.com. It&#8217;s a place where you can find out how your block patterns or the block patterns in the directory look with any of the block themes that are in the repository. I did a few tests and I&#8217;m delighted to see that block patterns will persist even when you switch the theme on your site, so something that&#8217;s very hard to do with third party page builders but that&#8217;s also very hard to do with classic themes where you sometimes lose content just because you switch themes. Now with block patterns that&#8217;s a much better build and they all persist, including the design, when you switch the theme. It&#8217;s really interesting to see. Speaking of block pattern, there&#8217;s a small change in the pattern directory. The meta team has added now a featured category so the best patterns you can look up in the featured category. You can also select them from the inserter inside of the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another community contribution came from Marius Jensen. He updated his plug-in called persistent block editor settings. He added support for the following user settings, block breadcrumbs, that&#8217;s the breadcrumbs on the bottom of a screen, on and off, change the most used blocks to what the user actually is doing and the caret positioning. Then all the settings are stored in the individual user profile information on the site so that persists between computer or browser changes. I think it&#8217;s a great plug-in and many, many people have asked for that. It has quite a following on the WordPress repository. I also think that sooner or later, I know that the core team is working on something like that, but it&#8217;s still blocked by some of the not finished things I would say. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes. It&#8217;s in progress for so long. There were several approaches that tried to address that. Maybe it&#8217;s good that it didn&#8217;t happen before because now we will have several screens for the editor and that brings another level of complexity. Still, the way it&#8217;s structured, even in the local storage of the browser, so it persists per browser at the moment, it&#8217;s still something that might change slightly at the time of the WordPress 5.9 release. Starting from that, I guess it&#8217;s a very good moment to finally bring the same functionality to core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. You mentioned this, I was just &#8230; you were distracting me because I was counting the different editor screens that we have now and it&#8217;s quite a few. It&#8217;s a post editor, it&#8217;s a widget screen, it&#8217;s a template editor, it&#8217;s a template parts editor, it&#8217;s the reusable block editor. It&#8217;s really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s a lot. I mean some of them are the same editors behind the scenes, but conceptually they are different. Now, as we will cover soon, we also have this zoom mode so you can switch in the editor as it will be called from now on from a full template view to the template part view, so that&#8217;s yet another way of looking at that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 11.6</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well finally, half an hour into the show, we are at the releases. Gutenberg 11.6 was released on September 29th. The WP Tavern covered some of it and of course some of it is also in the &#8230; oh, the WP Tavern actually had two posts about it. One is about the release as a whole and the other one was introducing the new API for locking blocks. I think that was one of the major features there. Let&#8217;s go through that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We start with the query pagination now can use the flex layout which is really cool. The site logo now has the feature to crop the image. If your logo that you uploaded is not fitting in the spot you can crop it. Now it&#8217;s also possible to zoom and rotate the image, so that is really a step forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: There is this item for gallery block which is at toolbar bottom to convert old galleries to new format. I&#8217;m not quite sure it&#8217;s something that will stay for longer, or is it something for the transition period, but it&#8217;s great that this is now possible because it will help with the ongoing efforts to bring inner blocks for the gallery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack:</em> The gallery block has experienced a refactor, instead of just having the IDs of the images in there and then rendering them it actually comprises now of single image blocks that you can add all the different features that you have with the image block also to the single image in a gallery block. You have then the gallery outer and then the inner blocks are image blocks. The roll-out is, in that regard it will not automatically convert the old to the new galleries until it&#8217;s rolled out and until it&#8217;s coming to core because right now it&#8217;s still an experiment. You can switch that over to the new gallery. It&#8217;s called update, the button in your gallery toolbar and then you can convert it to the new format. I think in the final roll-out, when you open up the post it will automatically convert it, but not with all the previous. It will not touch that unless you really wanted or unless you edit that particular post. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the color picker got changed and is rolled out, it&#8217;s more accessible and it also has a copy function and all that. It also makes the rounds now, we saw it in 11.6 as well as in 11.7, that&#8217;s gradually exchanged on all the blocks. Do you know anything else about the color picker?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: No, I know that there is a big redesign happening. I don&#8217;t know why, but there&#8217;s always a reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. I think it was accessibility problems that the old color picker had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Oh. Maybe, as far as I remember that was something that was worked on before, WordPress 5.0, which was a long time ago. I&#8217;m sure it was accessible enough to get through to the release then. Maybe there was some concerns that are addressed now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Now there is a simple styles preview in the sidebar of the template editor or site editor that you can modify some of the styles in your panel and it also now uses a navigation component. That&#8217;s just the underlying feature for the global styles preview.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. For the preview you see some characters and it shows the typography, how it looks in practice and also the colors that are applied to that. It just gives you a slight preview so you don&#8217;t have to navigate through the page and look for that. It&#8217;s pretty useful in my opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. You see the final version of it right now in the video from last night&#8217;s meeting of the go/no go when Matias Ventura was demoing it. It&#8217;s a nice &#8230; also with additional color palettes. It has received quite a few iterations since it got added to the plug-in. Full site editing, there is now basic support, the executive word is basic support for child themes when you have a block theme so you can have different features added or switched on and off in your child theme that maybe the parent theme doesn&#8217;t allow. You have different color settings and any settings that you want to you can do in your theme.json for the child theme and still get updates for your parent theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. The feature that I mentioned a few minutes before is a way to edit template parts in a special view. When you are editing your template you can use this dropdown menu which is an icon with three dots. There is this new option, edit template part. When you click that, everything disappears but the template part and you can focus on editing only that area, which is pretty handy. In the context when there is a lot of blocks sometimes it&#8217;s hard to see when the template part starts or ends. I like this addition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>APIs</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. Then we come to the lock control for block type level. As we mentioned there&#8217;s an article that covers that as a whole at the WP Tavern. At the attribute level it supports locking the block from being moved or removed and it hides the block moving errors and the delete button if the block is locked. You can use that also with your &#8230; it&#8217;s just an attribute in the block.json if I see this correctly. You can also use that for your block patterns. That can have locked and unlocked blocks. That&#8217;s-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Oh yeah. That&#8217;s true. That would be a good use case, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. That&#8217;s also something that Matias demonstrated yesterday, last night in the video. What else do we want to point out from the 11.6? Bug fixes, well we&#8217;re going to jump over the bug fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I think you had something highlighted for the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah, the experiments. The experiments, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Basic plug-in support.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Experiments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. Sorry. The site editor now has basic also, our executive word is basic plug-in support. It adds the support for the plug-in sidebar. The site editor is now the editor and that&#8217;s where you do the full site editing pieces. The sidebar there can now be targeted by plug-ins for the sidebar, for the menu items in the menu as well as close and open general sidebar action. Plug-in developers, extenders will really be happy to hear about that. We were waiting for that too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a big push for documentation updates, especially for the packages and the components. Developers can now look up some of the documentation and don&#8217;t have to figure out from code what does this do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. I guess there were also some updates related to how to contribute to the WordPress components package. That&#8217;s the most important part that builds all the experience, all the UI elements and so on. There&#8217;s a lot of movement in that area which also shapes how global styles look. You can see a lot of changes in that area. That&#8217;s all because of these efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. All right. Code quality, I think that was all &#8230; was that all that we wanted to say about 11.6 in this episode?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Gutenberg 11.7 Release</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I guess we have a lot of cover also from 11.7 that was released on October 13th. It would be fair to say that we are done with the 11.6 release and just move to the next one because it was a huge one and there was a lot of enhancements included in this one, way more than the one we already covered.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me start with the changes to the block editor. With the work, ongoing work on the navigation block and all the child blocks there was a need to have a way to use also slash inserter in this content. So far you could do it only through the paragraph block, which was quite a big limitation. It is now fixed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s enabled to some of the links to the blocks that allow you to insert links and stuff like this. When you insert a link and it has some name, when you delete that name and write a slash then you will be able to insert a block, other types of blocks that fit in that context, which is pretty good. This is something that is still, the API behind that is still experimental. Every block author there can experiment with that by enabling the flag called underscore experimental slash inserter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. I think what that also does is give you a little input screen from the slash inserter, not that you have to &#8230; up until now the slash inserter only added, gives you fast access to adding a block, but now you can actually add also some parameters to that and enter it right there. That&#8217;s a real speeding up the workflow quite tremendously. As you said, any block can have that so it&#8217;s also the plug-in, the blocks that come with plug-ins can also use that. That&#8217;s really good, immediately extender friendly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also has added or enabled the ability to create pages directly from the inline link UI on the navigation bar. The new empty page gets created, that&#8217;s a feature that comes over from the other editor screen but I think I really like how they implemented that, the new empty page gets created behind the scenes with a title set on the text typed in the search input field. That&#8217;s definitely also a fast way to create a menu when you know you have the outline of your website and you just create the menu headers and then it automatically creates all the pages for it as well. That&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. At the end of the process of creating your navigation you just go to those pages and fill it with content, which is pretty nice. It should speed up the whole process really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Exactly. Yeah. In 11.6 came the site logo cropping and image manipulating features, now you also get, with 11.7 you also get duotone support which means that you can have a fixed color scheme around your website. Every image that you have might fit better into it. Really that&#8217;s a cool thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes. Exactly. There&#8217;s more for the columns block, they enabled the block gap feature which we covered in past episodes. When it&#8217;s combined with vertical margin support you can have a really nice effect, so finally you can add some spaces between columns and there is a control for that which allows that and some nice animations that support that. It&#8217;s a very nice way that was missing for so long. Now it&#8217;s finally implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. If you&#8217;re a theme developer who has actually taken out the gap between the columns, you can now, it can now be done through the interface. I saw some nice animations or demos where you have three columns that are a different color but they don&#8217;t have a boundary so they go from one color to the next without the background color of the site shining through which is quite a nice effect when you just want to liven up the text, the wall of text when you&#8217;re writing so much and just have some graphical play around with it interspersed there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The navigation, oh yeah, from the navigation block you can now transform your link into other allowed navigation blocks. You can transform it into a sub-menu, menu or a site logo or a home link or a social icon, which is cool if you change your mind on some of the links.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;m not quite sure what happened with the content. For instance, if you have a site logo and you want to transform it into something else, which probably will have a different URL, it might be it uses just the same URL and then you just need to edit that. Anyways, it&#8217;s a really interesting idea to speed up the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Well this one is actually only going from a link to something else, not the other way around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Oh, is it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> The initial idea that I always, that stuck in my mind, all the transforms should be two ways. If you convert from something you are able to convert that back. Maybe it&#8217;s now relaxed, you can always use an undo button and that should be pretty much it. I guess it&#8217;s whatever makes it easier for the user is fine from my perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah, I think I need to press that for this if there is a way going back, just from a social icon link to just a mere menu link. Maybe it&#8217;s a different context here. Yeah. Now you can actually &#8230; there was a problem when you have these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Just to explain that, why the rule was like that, when you are transforming from the heading to the paragraph then you use the same content and it&#8217;s pretty straightforward. However, if you would like to go from the image to cover block then you have only the image, but as soon as you add some heading or something like that in the cover image, when you go back to the image block then it isn&#8217;t quite sure what should happen with this heading. You could lose some content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. No, I get it. Yeah. I&#8217;ve only been situational, but I&#8217;ve never had a situation that I have already a cover block and only want to go back to an image. I think that&#8217;s just a lack of imagination I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Also, when you&#8217;ve invested so much time to polish your cover block and make it pretty, it doesn&#8217;t make any sense to go back to the image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. That&#8217;s so true. Yes, yeah. The next item on our list is show none as an alignment option and use contextual text to clarify the settings. There are now hints included in the alignment options, spread text maximum wide, 720 pixels wide or something like that. It explains a little bit to the user what does it mean when you change something to align wide or to full width. Some users had trouble to see, I&#8217;m one of those, to see that you can uncheck those alignments and then remove it. Now there is and option that says no alignment, just do what you normally do as a block, don&#8217;t make it wider or go out of the content. I think that&#8217;s a good addition there because I got totally and utterly confused. Oh, I can switch it just off. It was not a good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, you had to click on the same option again to disable it, which wasn&#8217;t so straightforward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: It wasn&#8217;t clear. That&#8217;s a toggle switch, that wasn&#8217;t clear. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I wanted to emphasize that the number you mentioned is not something that is hard colored, it depends on the theme. It is able to, the context there provides very useful information which can vary between themes, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Is that coming from the theme.json file do you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: They probably compute it on the fly using some JavaScript.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Okay. Yeah. All right. That&#8217;s great, but we&#8217;re not done yet. What&#8217;s the next thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Format library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: This is one of the options you have when you have text based blocks. Before it was only possible to change the foreground color of your text, so change it to something different. Now there is also an option to change the background color or the highlight how it&#8217;s called in other tools. The change was applied to the existing controls so now you have a pop up dialogue, I don&#8217;t know, which has tabs so you can switch between text and background and apply those different colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: I think that&#8217;s a feature that has been missing from the beginning for a very long time. There was something that you could do in the classic editor very easily with the little toolbars up there that you can just highlight a word in your text within the paragraph and then give it a different text color or give it a different background color. The text color was still there, is already there, but now you can change the background color of that. Yeah. You find it at the same place where you also find the text color change in your paragraph toolbar. You can now, as a theme developer you can now also set presets on the duotone for your theme. If you say every duotone, when it comes out of default, should be a blue filter or a pink filter or something like that, you can help your user to set the right duotone on certain images in the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. You can change it per block, so that&#8217;s pretty nice. You can say, oh, site logo, I want to have it in a red filter and that&#8217;s also possible now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. The possibilities become endless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. In general all the management for colors becomes so complex that now it got extracted, the color palette is in its own global styles screen. Basically you need to, when you go to the editor for editing, for changing your site, when you go to the styles sidebar, now you need to first click on the color link and then it will show all the colors you have. You can also drill down to the palette or individual elements to change those settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: As the next iteration, probably not for 5.9 because it takes a little more, but one of the features that will come is that you can, in that you can also have multiple color palettes to choose from or have a color palette directory where you can grab a wonderful &#8230; yeah, Matt Mullenweg actually mentioned that in yesterday&#8217;s video that there is a colorpalette.com site where you can pick the color palette that you like and then you get all the hex decimal values for it for your site. That would be so cool to actually have a source like that that can pull in new color palettes for your theme there or for your site. Yeah, this has opened so many possibilities, it&#8217;s really mind-boggling. Right now we just have these three screens, all the styles, the color styles and then the color palette separate where you can add additional colors to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s really hard to wrap your head around how colors work at the moment. If I am correct, now you have the default colors that come from the WordPress core, then you have theme styles that every theme can provide and it looks like you can also, the users can define their own colors right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. The hierarchy is users first, then the theme, then the core, but it&#8217;s also that the theme can say please disable custom colors, my users don&#8217;t know how to use color.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: To offset or to avoid the GeoSitters interesting page designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> To make it even more advanced, it&#8217;s also possible to say that, a theme author can say that for this particular block I want to have a different color palette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haac</em>k: Yeah, yeah, yeah. There&#8217;s also something new and I didn&#8217;t realize that until now when I see the screenshot that I was looking at here from the post. In the styles there was, up until 11.6, with the new version now you can actually go directly to the blocks to change their settings. Before you had to close the sidebar from the style, from the global styles and go back to &#8230; when you do template editing you have to go back to the blocks sidebar. There wasn&#8217;t a clear path for that. Now you can, I see here blocks is another panel that you can open there. That&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, next thing, the template editor got some new workflow things. There&#8217;s a back button now for the isolated template part editor. When you drill down you can go back up the rabbit hole again. Then also the template areas have added some template details like header and footer areas there. That&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: When you go to the header and you click on the name of the template you are currently editing, you not only see the details about the theme template but also some details about template areas used in that template which allows you to quickly navigate to them because there are dropdown menus with additional options.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Experiments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Exactly. Yeah. Then the navigation screen still in experimental has a new feature that you can add tool tips to navigation items in their set-up states. That is interesting and helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I guess it&#8217;s coming from the block editor. When there&#8217;s something wrong, the link is missing in your navigation where it should be, then it just underlines it with the squiggly line. When you hover over it it just shows you what the issue is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. You don&#8217;t want to have in the menu a link or a menu item that doesn&#8217;t go anywhere. That helps you too. Then the next one is insert the navigation link blocks by default in the navigation block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. Basically, when you click on the plus sign to add another item, you can start writing and it will show you a list of matching links. You can just click on one of them and that will add it to the menu. You don&#8217;t have to choose the type or you don&#8217;t, give me category page, no, we just type the name of the link and it just does everything behind the scenes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. That&#8217;s a very nice feature because in the current menu screen you really have to know what kind of type you&#8217;re looking for. This goes away right away with that feature. I&#8217;ve got to test it, what happens with custom post types and post categories or are these pages also being surfaced. Yeah. Wow, that was a lot in this release. Do you have anything else? I think that was it, the major parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. We had to cover two Gutenberg plug-in releases pretty packed with features. I guess that&#8217;s a lot already to process for our listeners.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. In one sitting, yes. Let&#8217;s go to the active development and what&#8217;s discussed. I wanted to highlight again the gallery block refactor will come out of the experimental stage with the next plug-in release, that&#8217;s 11.8, that&#8217;s in two weeks. It will be in 5.9, WordPress 5.9. At the moment we&#8217;re doing the extender outreach to plug-in and theme developers to alert them to the changes. If you are one of those and/or you work for agencies but you don&#8217;t have public plug-ins or themes in the repository, then I would suggest to go to the developer note that Clan has already published a month ago on the changes so you can see if that affects your gallery handling in your theme or your plug-in. We will have it in the show notes of course.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then on the FSE Outreach Program update Anne McCarthy has another call for questions where you click on a button and have your question and then it gets sent to her inbox and then she finds the answers for that and she will publish all the questions and answers in a post later on. The deadline for getting your question in is October 27th, that&#8217;s in two weeks. Then she will, within a week, publish that post. This is also for 5.9 when full-site editing comes in with early access there that you can get your questions answered, or also your fears, either way is fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I think we should also include a link to the previous installment and all the answers. I think there were about 50 questions answered. That was a lot. Maybe that would be also good to check. Maybe you already have answers for your questions and you don&#8217;t have to reach out again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Right. Yeah. I think the reason that Anne does it now at this stage is because the last one was at the beginning of the year. With the, I don&#8217;t know, six or seven plug-in releases that happened since then, quite a few things have changed, some irritations that were &#8230; because it was annoying or it was an interface that didn&#8217;t make sense, you had questions there, but that has been already fixed so the new questions certainly also in regards to the go/no go decision, I would wait until the post is out, to read through it and get &#8230; some of the answers might be in that summary post from the go/no go meeting that Hector will publish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then also from the FSE Outreach Program was the summary of the theme switching experience. It was a great read. There were quite a few theme developers who had some expectations there that also went through, some site owners went through the testing and had some surprises there. Channing Ritter on the design team did some nice mock-ups on how to make it a better experience. It might not be part of 5.9, but it&#8217;s definitely something that you who sent in or did the test have influenced how the next steps are going to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that, get your questions in, think about the gallery block refactor and then live Q&amp;A October 28th with the BuddyPress team members on converting classic widgets to blocks. This is the end of our show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. I wanted to remind everyone that we are waiting for more reviews and that&#8217;s always great to hear from you what do you think about the show. You can also ping us on Twitter or send DMs with questions, with the feedback, whatever you&#8217;d like to talk about with us. My handle is GZIOLO and Birgit is BPH.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yes. As always, the show notes will be published on <a href=\"http://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast\">GutenbergTimes.com/podcast</a>.

Thank you so much for being here and a big thank you for our listeners to stay with us so truthfully into another long episode. That&#8217;s it for me. Goodbye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Thank you, Birgit. Thank you everyone for waiting four weeks for the next episode. See you in two weeks. We won&#8217;t do so long breaks for quite a while I hope.

We’re recording this on September 16th, 2021. In today&#8217;s episode we will talk about the planning scope and team for WordPress 5.9, the roadmap for WooCommerce blocks and of course this week&#8217;s Gutenberg 11.5 release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am Birgit Pauli-Haack, WordPress developer advocate and curator for Gutenberg Times. Again, I&#8217;m delighted to have with me on the show co-host Grzegorz, or Greg, Ziółkowski, JavaScript developer at Automattic and WordPress core contributor. Hi, Grzegorz, how are you doing today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Hello, Birgit. I&#8217;m fine. I&#8217;m looking forward to my vacation that starts this weekend. I&#8217;m going to Greece. It&#8217;s first time since two years going abroad, so I am really excited but also not so happy about all the paperwork that is necessary to travel these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, with all the COVID and vaccines and all that kind of thing, is that what you&#8217;re referring to with paperwork?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yes. I have five forms to fill in for myself and my family. It&#8217;s strange. I guess you know that because you traveled from the States to Germany a few weeks back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Yeah, we did. I scheduled my test that I have to do because the United States changed how they let people in. Now I have to have a test that&#8217;s not older than three days to get in although I&#8217;m vaccinated. It&#8217;s strange. It&#8217;s all strange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, yeah. At least I don&#8217;t have to do any tests because I&#8217;m also vaccinated. That&#8217;s on the good side here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, on the way in we only needed to show our vaccination records and be done with it. On the way back it&#8217;s going to be both.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, we start our episode today with an announcement, with an announcement that Josepha Haden Chomphosy published the preliminary planning for WordPress 5.9. That&#8217;s supposed to be released December 14, 2021. Yes. It&#8217;s again just before the holidays and many sites will wait until January to update, but most sites it turns out update right away. We did this, had this exercise now for the last four years I think as far as I can remember.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yes, even WordPress 5.0 was released on December 8th, 9th, I don&#8217;t remember exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> 6th?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Maybe 3rd. It was in December and we had the same discussion, why it&#8217;s happening just before Christmas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> We are a worldwide project, it is not only Christmas for people, some people don&#8217;t even know what that is and they just have their own holidays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. The world does not stop when WordPress releases. We found that out with 5.0. The internet did not break and everything was going smoothly. I know there are a few US agencies that want to close down over Christmas and they just &#8230; yeah, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a hard sell for them to say we do all the upgrades in January when we come back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> It&#8217;s perfectly fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I think so too, yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, as they did for 5.8, there will be a go/no-go decision for what will be in the release. That is scheduled to happen on October 12th. That&#8217;s about four weeks ago, in four weeks, sorry. That&#8217;s in four weeks. The feature freeze will be November 9th and then beta one is supposed to be ready for November 16th. People get cracking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I think this series is a bit smaller in the scope, so I think that those dates make a lot of sense. I think the schedule for the 5.8 was a bit longer, especially between the feature freeze there was two weeks, but at the end of the day I don&#8217;t think that matters that much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mostly not for Gutenberg because you patch back to the WordPress right away when you have bug fixes, yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scope follows pretty much what Matías Ventura published earlier this month as the preliminary scope, so we will have blocks with intrinsic web design, then the navigation menus, interface, the user interface for the theme JSON. Theme JSON was introduced for theme developers for 5.8 and 5.9 will have the first version of the interface so users can also configure their themes and their block editor through that. There&#8217;s also refining of editing flows for block themes, a new default theme and additional design tools from the block editor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there are a few, Josepha called them hopefuls that might get in but they might not get in. Part of it is the pattern insertion and creation features so that you can submit patterns to the directory and then also insert them directly from the inserter. Right now you have to click the copy button and then copy/paste them. For 5.9 the meta team is aiming for insertion into the block editor. Then also unzip/rollback fail-safe, there&#8217;s a whole team working on that, more PHP unit tests and then improved compatibility with PHP 8.0 and 8.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> The last three items aren&#8217;t related to the Gutenberg at all, but in some ways they improve the overall quality on WordPress core, so it&#8217;s maybe somehow related.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right. Right. Yeah. That&#8217;s that. The team is, release lead is again Matt Mullenweg with Josepha being the coordinator I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: And the marketing team lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And the marketing team lead, yeah, with that. Who else is there already in the posting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I&#8217;ve seen that a few days before and the list was still missing a few names. I don&#8217;t know if it was updated since then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That was quite a while ago. Here we go. September third was it published. The team, to go back to that, release lead is Matt Mullenweg, marketing and comms is Josepha Haden, technical writer is Jonathan Bossenger and those are the leads that are filled in. I think the rest is going to come together when the meeting is, the board chair meeting later on. All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yes. There&#8217;s still time to volunteer if some of our listeners want to jump in and help with the release, even as people who just watch the process and be ready for the next major release to take this leadership role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Josepha asked for volunteers for triage lead and the release coordinators. If you don&#8217;t triage the bugs or the tickets that are supposed to go into 5.9 and see how they&#8217;re going you&#8217;re not going to get a release together. The coordinators are really important to get all the teams ready and working on this. I think there are a few volunteers already on the post in the comments section, but you can still throw your hat in the ring. That is about 5.9. I think the next date for that to watch is October 12th with the go/no-go because that will determine what exactly will come into the release from the navigation screen, new navigation blocks, see how far the gallery block, the new gallery block, refacted, is going. That&#8217;s still in the experiment. There are a few other things that might or might not come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski: </em>Yeah. I think the most important one would be the navigation block and the navigation screen. That&#8217;s quite a huge project that has evolved for quite a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. I think over almost two years. It&#8217;s also, I just saw and we&#8217;ll see it in the updates later there are some discussions going on that our listeners might want to chime in in terms of backwards compatibility.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We promised also a Woocommerce roadmap regarding blocks. Darren Either from the team put a nice blog post together with a lot of information about that, what is happening and what is in the near future or what is soon happening. The high priority is to build robust blocks for checkout and cart, the shopping cart, that not only gives the store and their customers a much better user experience but also allows for extensibility for third-party tools. The blocks will become the default way to handle checkout and carts soon. They were a little bit cagey with dates and something, but it&#8217;s definitely something to watch out for. They will also have, for the transition, fallbacks to shortcuts and the shortcuts for cards and checkout and then if the extension isn&#8217;t optimized for blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. We will include also a link to the GitHub repository that contains all the blocks. There are a few of them. They are very advanced I must say. In the WordPress core we have a lot of blocks, however they are more on the side of editing content so the complexity comes only in the block editor, whereas Woo, they do something really impressive on the front-end so those blocks are interactive, they are optimized in terms of performance. There&#8217;s some really impressive work on their side. I&#8217;ve been watching that for quite a while, this is in the works for over two years now, and they are improving. Their initial implementation, it was mostly bringing back compatibility from shortcuts, that was transitioned from shortcuts to blocks. I remember the first prototype, it was creating the safe implementation, the short code and that was just not working. Their block editor experience was the change but the rest has stayed the same. They have evolved in so many ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also shared some ways for the users and shop owners, the checkout flows are now much more smoother and that leads to better conversion rates, which is the whole goal of this concept. It&#8217;s also, now you have the ability to preview how cart and checkout looks from the editor. It sounds, in our context when we talk all the time about the block editor the preview is something you just take for granted, but here we are, it&#8217;s improvement in their workflows. They were also talking about the iterations they are doing and how they are trying to use InnerBlocks to structure or architect their blocks. That&#8217;s also a great way when they are presenting in the post how it empowers users to add their own integration pretty easily. You have now a checkout form and you can inject any type of blocks, you can add a heading in any place you want, you can add, I don&#8217;t know, an image. Whatever you like you can add there and also reorder items like change headings. It&#8217;s something that wasn&#8217;t possible before and this just opens new possibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also happy to see that this flow is now becoming the default one, because it was present but it was only for some extensions that were in Woocommerce store by default. Now it&#8217;s open also to plug-in others. That&#8217;s the biggest change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I really like how Darren put the post together. He has many, many screenshots in there so you get really a good picture of what&#8217;s going to happen. Check it out. There&#8217;s also some work being done to prepare Woocommerce for the site editing feature that&#8217;s coming to 5.9 somehow, or 6.0. I think it was good for the Woocommerce team to wait until the block editor was a little bit more stable and had more features for extensibility. I&#8217;m glad that they found it now worthwhile to put it together and that the user experience is up to the quality that they wanted to. That will open up the signal also for other plug-in developers and also gives quite a nice set of example code that you can study if you are into reading code. As Greg said, we&#8217;re going to share not only post the show notes, but also the GitHub repository so you can check it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I have the last announcement, then we get to the release, our next live Q&amp;A on the Gutenberg Times YouTube channel will be October 7 at 16:00 UTC, 11AM Eastern and 18:00 Central Europe Time. Sorry. Got all the times mixed up again. That is pretty much the story of this week for me. I go either way and I always go wrong, so I need to read it and pronounce it right. October 7, 16:00 UTC. We will discuss with experienced WordPress theme developers how they transition from building a classic theme to a block based theme and using theme JSON and also full site editing and the global styles as far as it&#8217;s already available.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will have as a guest Ellen Bauer. They published just recently their Aino theme. That is their block based theme and they have additional features in there that will cover that. Carolina Nymark, who&#8217;s on the themes team and also worked on the 2021 blocks, TT1 Blocks theme, that&#8217;s the block based 2021 product. She also has a site called full-site editing where she teaches full-site editing to theme developers. It&#8217;s great to have her on the show. Then the last one is Andres Norén who designed the 2020 default theme last year. He&#8217;s working on a new theme as we speak. Oh yeah, by the way, his theme Eksell is actually powering the Gutenberg Times site for, I don&#8217;t know, half a year now. I&#8217;m glad to have those two, Ellen and Carolina and Andres, on the show on October 7th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, I think the line-up is just so great. I&#8217;m looking forward to this Q&amp;A session. I think you did a great job convincing all the people who have so much experience building full site editing themes to be on the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;m really happy that they all make the time to educate our community on this. Also not only to be on the show, to take the time, but also take the time and work through this because we all know that, if you are an early adopter, you basically do all the bug testing and quality assurance for the team, but you also have to invest a lot more time because of course documentation is not yet complete or changes. It&#8217;s a major undertaking and I&#8217;m glad that these three are coming to the show and telling us what they have found.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. There is also this bright side that you are on the bleeding edge of innovation and you are part of the process and you influence how this all shapes up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I think it has more pros than cons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, absolutely. Looking back, the three years, block editor, most of the early adopters have had, really a jump on the new technology and, yeah, were supported by big acquisitions or hired just right away because of their expertise that they have shown. It will be similar to theme developers that are early adopting these new features, even if it&#8217;s a little bit of a heartache or a headache, more a headache. It&#8217;s the cutting edge, indeed. Sometimes it&#8217;s the bleeding edge, you&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. In this context, which makes me very happy, is that all three invited guests, they are in the community for quite a while and they seem to be aligned with the vision and they are adjusting their themes to be up-to-date, which is really impressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, they totally get the vision. All three of them have published quite a bit of their learnings. Yes, I will share a few links in the show notes so you can check them out, but definitely sign up for, register for the live Q&amp;A so you get also your questions answered.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 11.5</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to the Gutenberg 11.5 release. We are, as of today there is not a final release yet because there&#8217;s some problems with the build sequence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, it&#8217;s some turbulence like during the flight. I mean everything is ready, it&#8217;s just the process didn&#8217;t end up successfully and it&#8217;s more of the technical challenge of the release process itself than something is wrong. Yeah, I hope at the time when this podcast will be produced and ready then the release will be out, hopefully today. We said the date for recording before assuming that everything goes out on Wednesday as usual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah. Well there was, the 11.5 release candidate is out or has been out for a week, so that&#8217;s what we are basing things on. There weren&#8217;t any changes on it from the features or the PRs, it&#8217;s just the build process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Features</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. We have a few new features. Do you want to talk us through it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. Let&#8217;s start with the block support changes. In the previous episode we mentioned that gap block support feature. That was still an experiment. It was implemented on the team JSON side, but it was disabled by default. Now we have this support, there&#8217;s a UI for that. It&#8217;s pretty simple. In the dimensions panel, if I recall correctly, we have this control that allows you to change the gap between blocks. The name is still to be settled as far as I know because it has some, in the world of design there is something similar that might be confusing, but it was, you just change the numbers and it just increases the spacing between blocks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related to that there is also a change in the group block. At the moment the group block has this layout option, layout control that allows you to change how it is presented. By default it just uses, every block in the group is in its own row, however this new feature is just integrated with the inserter that inserts a group block with every block in the same row. They are aligned, next to each other in one line, which is pretty nice for some complex designs. This is just, it was there in the group black, it&#8217;s just the new way of discovering this feature in the inserter, in the slash inserter when you are typing in the prompt in the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s the first implementation of the Flex layout that I think Riad actually put the basis in for with 11.4. Now this is the first iteration where one block is actually using that. Of course there will be more. In the PR, if you want to follow up on that, there are some links back to the Flex layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, but I think the Flex layout we talked about one or two episodes before.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right. Yeah, but there was not a block that came with it out of the gate. It&#8217;s also part of what&#8217;s in 5.9 being the intrinsic design of pages. There will also be, another change is actually that the bug report form, which is one of the most important forms on the GitHub repo, has received some changes. The ones that are here in that release are more cosmetic but I wanted to point it out, the new template feature of GitHub is now used and they created a new bug report form to remind people of all the information that would be helpful if someone would take on an issue to fix it. I encountered quite a few issues where we needed to find out what actually the user used, what versions they are or what are the steps to reproduce it. Those are very important information. If we have to read minds what&#8217;s actually happening, we might not get to reproduce the error or the quirkiness that is and we have to go back and ask for further information. That is just delaying the time of the fixing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the form is now much easier and you don&#8217;t forget anything. I also wanted to point that out for those who are in the GitHub repo. Let us know, or let the team know when there is something to be fixed or not working right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s a nice change. Usually it sends up someone needs to ask for more details. After a few weeks, if there is no answer, the issue is closed, which isn&#8217;t something we really want. It is just the reality because we cannot reproduce the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. There&#8217;s no questioning the experience of the person who posts it, it&#8217;s just we need to see it, we need to be able to reproduce it to locate where the code change needs to happen to actually fix it. It&#8217;s just saving a lot of time and being very specific in what&#8217;s not working. Yeah. Yeah. Next the block library has got some new enhancements. One of them is using the block gap between column blocks, so that is another iteration of a new feature. Now you can….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, but this has only changed on the CSS level for now. As the rich table in the PR set, it&#8217;s a stop gap for block gap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Nice, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Fun with words. Yeah, but that&#8217;s the direction, I guess. Most of those layout related blocks should start using those design controls, elements, to make the experience more cohesive. That in general is the direction where it&#8217;s heading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. There was an article in the WP Tavern about what controls somebody could use, should use or should be having out of default and not changeable, who&#8217;s having control over themes? I think there were some misunderstandings. Matías went into the comments section and clarified a few things regarding that. If you come across an article go into the comments and see what Matías has to say as well. Matías Ventura, the spark of Gutenberg, just to reiterate that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The video block got an enhancement to use the existing video poster image on insert. The video block has become quite powerful and quite flexible. There are six or seven different settings that you can have in the sidebar that you can switch on and off. This issue or feature is now that, once you assign a poster image to the video the first time, it remembers it. When you embed it into a page or post again, because it&#8217;s in a different context or it&#8217;s in a series of videos or something like that, you don&#8217;t have to assign the poster image again, it will remember it. It&#8217;s all about the effort to streamline the content creator&#8217;s workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> There is also a change in the query pagination next and previous blocks. They are very low level blocks that construct the query pagination, which is part of Query Loop Block, but it shows how flexible the InnerBlocks paradigm is. There is now an arrow attribute that syncs next/previous block arrows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. It was there before, but it wasn&#8217;t really good, visible in the sidebar or for people to check on. Now they are real settings that are big buttons that you can click so it changes. You were always able to change the text of your pagination from next to previous page or something else. You say low level, but it&#8217;s also quite an important block because, when you get to full-site editing and you write your own templates and you have a list of block posts from a category or from a tag and you have multiple pages of those, you want that query pagination to be available and also be usable. It&#8217;s quite interesting, especially for publishers that have online magazines or so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> There&#8217;s also a change in the post outer block. You&#8217;ve got duotone support. At first I was surprised seeing that, but there is an avatar or the image of the user which got this feature, which is, again, a good to have way to apply similar effects to all images on your page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, or just make it blend in more into the overall design because it&#8217;s a small avatar. To normalize it amongst all the others that you have on your site. There&#8217;s also, the wide alignment control now is only available if the theme provides the layout wide size setting. I think that&#8217;s a change to, so you can adjust that setting through the theme JSON again and not have to &#8230; yeah, you don&#8217;t have to do it through the functions PHP now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. I think in the past you would enable full and wide at once, so it just gives you more grand control over those features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, you can now decide, okay, I only want the wide but not the full, or you only want the full but not the wide kind of thing. Yeah. That&#8217;s a good point. Yeah. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> There is also a quite important change for the navigation screen that&#8217;s being in the works and preparing for the final release. They are the undo and redo buttons in the editors, it&#8217;s the same feature that you have for the post content editor in the headers, it was just missing there. Definitely an important change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh yeah, yeah. All in the streaming of the content creator&#8217;s workflow. Streamlining, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. It&#8217;s also related to the keyboard shortcuts. Some of you probably use command Z and command X. No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The redo? I don&#8217;t know. I never redo, I only do undo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, command Z is the most popular one because you want to go back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I need to find out what the keyboard….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, check this out in the Gutenberg editor when you go to the header and there is three dots, menu, then you have keyboard shortcuts as one of the options. That&#8217;s the simplest way to check all the shortcuts and learn new if you don&#8217;t know them yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Yeah. There were other changes to the navigation screen. I just wanted to remind our listeners that it&#8217;s not yet in the plug-in per se, it&#8217;s still in experimentation so you need to go to the Gutenberg menu and the WP admin experiments section and then check the navigation screen so you can test it for yourself and try and help us get it tested and do a lot of bug fixes, bug reports there. There is also a change, the REST API team is working on creating the end points for the navigation editor for the menu. At the moment I think it&#8217;s all through the admin Ajax. The final version will use the REST API like any other places in the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, speaking of screens there&#8217;s a widget editor. It now received a widget group block for the widget screen which is quite nice now to follow the idea of classic widgets where you have a heading and then a widget. You can change the title of it and now you can add the heading and the widget into a group and then get it a little bit more contained and keep it together, style them and have a background of it and all that. It&#8217;s more what the user was accustomed to when dealing with widgets, the widget group helps with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. I would say it&#8217;s more to bridge the experience for everyone familiar with the widgets old screen. It seems like a good change in that regard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I like it, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I don&#8217;t know how it works technically. When you insert a widget does it wrap it with the group out of the box now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. I think you can highlight, like you do in the post editor, you highlight the things that you want to group and then you transform it into a widget group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. The widget group has all the group block settings as well in the sidebar. All right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some enhancements for the global styles or fixes. Now you are able to disable text and background colors via the theme JSON. I thought you were doing that before, but maybe it didn&#8217;t work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. As far as I know it&#8217;s related to some mock-ups that were presented. The idea is that you would be able to disable almost all the color customizations one by one. Maybe that worked only for the link before. There&#8217;s a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah. I think they changed a little bit the logic on how sub-components are shown in the color panel. Link color is enabled when the block supports it, the theme supports it, it&#8217;s launched by default. Yeah, it needs to be switched on or even the presets contain some solid value or the custom colors are used. Presets have some color. You need some color presets and the same is true for the text color, the background color and the gradients, although the gradients, you need to have either the custom colors in there or it&#8217;s empty, it&#8217;s disabled. For both the link color, text color and background color the block needs to support it, the theme needs to be supported and the defaults are different for each of them. Then the presets need to contain values for it. That&#8217;s quite a good set of logic there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, they streamlined all that logic and then now they are making the global styles available for all themes. That&#8217;s in PR 34334. I like that number, 34334. The preset classes for colors and font sizes were in the block library and they are now part of the global styles sheet that&#8217;s loaded later. That&#8217;s a change in the style sheets that are included by default. Then the preset classes look like the preset dev class. There are some changes. If you need to target those classes you might want to look at this again here. There is a post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I just shared a link with you from André is who one of the lead developers on the global styles project. He explains how the experience of using WordPress presets looked before team JSON and how it&#8217;s changed, how it got simplified. That would be a good read in this context. Also in the same PR that we are talking about, this 34, 334, there is a dev note sketched already that will be published later in the release process of WordPress 5.9. It also just covers what you, Birgit, just said. It&#8217;s pretty complex, so I guess that&#8217;s something that you should process at the time of learning how to use those presets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Then the media placeholder experienced another change. For now you can create a URL, if you wanted to add an image through the URL of the image you only could use absolute links. It needed to start with HTTP because it was a URL input type on the placeholder and that has changed to a text input type in some verification. Also now you can actually use local URLs. If you know the URL of your image that you want to add to a gallery or to a post, you can now use local URLs and don&#8217;t have to put in the domains, which is actually good when you move the site or move the site to a different domain, or you have just an image that&#8217;s somewhere in a different place than on the WP content uploads directory. That&#8217;s definitely a good thing that&#8217;s ….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, I personally was surprised that when you are using an input HTML tag, when you set the tag to URL it expects the full URL. That was the original issue that caused….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right. Caused this change, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> &#8230; this change. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. I think it was only Firefox, but the browser developers are really tightening up the browsing experience. That was a part of their verification so you wouldn&#8217;t be able to add it to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> There is also a quite important change for team developers. Now there are default editor styles that are applied to teams without team JSON and without editor styles. Sounds complex, but it&#8217;s just something that is even considered for the minor WordPress edits like 5.8 to now. It just adds some basic styles to all sides just to ensure that the experience is better for the block editor in particular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. This plays well out of the box even if the theme editor, the theme developer has not updated a style sheet for the theme. I think that&#8217;s a good place for the adoption of the block editor that we are all working towards, that more and more people adopt that, especially in the themes. If it&#8217;s nice looking out of the box and they don&#8217;t have to go back to the theme developer to style a column or to style images or the widened and full width or the media and text, that there are quirks, I think that&#8217;s a good decision now that theme developers can control it through theme JSON and their own editor styles. They can just the default styles. Yeah, that&#8217;s good work there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>New APIs</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ah, here it is. Of course, every time, and you hear me say this on this podcast quite a bit, every time you have a new feature you also need to provide the opt out of the feature. Here it is, allow themes with theme JSON to opt out of the block gap styles. There is a mechanism there how you do this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, I think it&#8217;s also related to the fact that it was opt in add styles, so now that&#8217;s probably, it has become a default so now you need to have a way to disable that if you don&#8217;t like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Now we moved also to the new API sections with this item on the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, yeah. Yeah. We have so many sections in this release note.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yes, it&#8217;s very long this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s very nice, yeah, but it&#8217;s also &#8230; it&#8217;s pretty much in the settings of your theme JSON. It&#8217;s settings, spacing, block gap, null. That&#8217;s how you opt out of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Quite a common way for all those global style related features. That&#8217;s the only item in the new API. Now it&#8217;s time for bug fixes. As usual, the list is very long.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> There seem to be not really big boo-boos that we have fixed. You find in the list under the block library fixes for the gallery block. I wanted to point out that those are referring to the gallery Refactor. This is the newly created gallery block. It&#8217;s still an experiment in the Gutenberg plug-in. If you want to do the navigation screen and test the new gallery block, you have to enable them also on the experiments screen of your Gutenberg plug-in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> You can always test the new gallery block on the new navigation screen and that&#8217;s two things at once tested properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> But don&#8217;t do this in production. It&#8217;s called experiment for a reason. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I mean for new websites I wouldn&#8217;t worry at all about enabling the new gallery factor block. I think the fact that it&#8217;s in experiment still is only because of backward compatibility.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. I would not say only. It&#8217;s a big part. It&#8217;s a big part and it&#8217;s also part of the headaches that they have, but it&#8217;s also &#8230; if you want to switch it on and you need a list of test instructions, I&#8217;ll link in the show notes to the GitHub issue 29882, 29882, because there&#8217;s a list of 40 tests that you can do, everything that you can do with a gallery block, you should do. We are preparing, on the developer relations team we are preparing an official call for testing that would hopefully get more people involved. We will also reach out to the plug-in developers to make sure they know about the new plug-in, new gallery block and update their features.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that the developer team has already tested the full plug-ins like CoBlocks and Jetpack blocks gallery blocks, but there are many, many more that need to be tested. If you have questions about that, feel free to DM me. Send me a direct message on WordPress Slack at BPH. Again, the test instructions that are right now out, that also the developers use, is the issue 29882, 29882. Of course we&#8217;ll link in the show notes. I just want to make sure that everybody knows this is coming and it&#8217;s cool.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s the Refactor? We talked about it before, but we always have new listeners. The gallery block as it is now is just a feature parity with the old classic editor gallery block where you have a list of images and then they&#8217;re all pulled in, but you&#8217;re not able to do much with those images except for moving them. You&#8217;re not able to adopt styles that are only for one image. The new gallery block is now a collection of single image blocks with which come all the features that you can do from an image block like obviously duotone, be it applying styles, applying backgrounds, adding a different link to each image and all these nice features. It&#8217;s a much richer experience for editors and you have much more freedom for it. It needs quite a few testings. Because of that switch of the InnerBlocks the extensions will change as well. I tested it about two months ago and I found that the gallery plug-ins that I used were working fine, but I&#8217;m not using all of the gallery blocks. It might have changed because there was some development on that. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, definitely the best part here is that now it doesn&#8217;t matter whether you are changing a dual image not a standalone block or it&#8217;s part of the gallery block, you have everything unified, the same controls, the same capabilities. It&#8217;s pretty cool to see that working this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Also all the extensions that you have for the image block are now also in the gallery block which is cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Cool is the right word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grzegorz Ziolkowski: Yeah. We are still on bug fixes. One of the changes that landed is for the writing flow, it&#8217;s in the block editor now. When you merge two blocks together the current position of the cursor is put in a better place than before. I don&#8217;t know what exactly was the issue, but it&#8217;s very annoying when you need to use arrows to move the cursor to the proper position when you change this type of modification, like when you have two paragraphs or similar text-related box.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Experiments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Then we get to the experiments but we have been talking about experiments before. Now you are able to put in the navigation block the site title as well as the logo and that makes it much nicer to assemble a header for a site when you use full site editing with that. It&#8217;s now really easy to have a logo and the site title and then the menu all in one line. Try it out and see if that works for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;m looking forward to see how the gallery block will evolve because the same feature that you have now in the navigation block could work there as well. I can imagine that you could inject a site logo also inside the gallery because why not, that would be also in some ways &#8230; you could have some designs where that would work. In general, the idea of InnerBlocks, this is what we really want because it just opens so many possibilities for designs that weren&#8217;t possible before. You had to hard code that in HTML in your PHP files and now it&#8217;s at your site, you just need to move some blocks around, insert something and then it just aligns nicely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It&#8217;s a good point, because now you could have, a three by three grid of images at the center could actually be a poem or something like that that is not an image but a text. The InnerBlocks really open up quite a few more possibilities, especially on the gallery block. That&#8217;s why the Refactor is so important and also that&#8217;s why it takes a little longer to merge into the plug-in because there are some things that need to be changed for backwards compatibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get, the social links now use the Flex layout. That means you can arrange the social links either vertically or horizontally I think and also have the block gap in between so you can have the distances also controlled. All kinds of different things are available now in the social links block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Those design tools are really powerful. I&#8217;m looking forward to having them all stable and released as part of WordPress 5.9. I hope it happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> We need testers. We need people who test things. The more bugs you find, the better the release will be in 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Now we are at the documentation. This section, do you see something that is a bigger one? There is a lot of typos that were fixed or some tooling that was improved like ESLint, something that is more in general for the Gutenberg project. Some improvements to bring the documentation up to date, like replacing, we select calls from WordPress data package to use, a react hook which is called useSelect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Good point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. I guess there isn&#8217;t anything very important that we have to mention today. Again, there&#8217;s a code quality. This section, it&#8217;s very long.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Code Quality</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But that&#8217;s your favorite section, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, I mean it depends what&#8217;s inside it. There are some changes to bring code up to date, similar to what I said about using most recent APIs that were developed and some errors which is &#8230; for those who don&#8217;t know there are some special validations for the code quality that helps us catch some bugs. Whenever they show up or the tools get updated and they are better at catching those bugs we try to fix this as soon as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Excellent. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> There&#8217;s a lot of refactoring that doesn&#8217;t have any impact on the user interface but helps for the longer, in terms of long term support for the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Various</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> No, I get it. That brings us also to my favorite section, the various section. There&#8217;s one item in there that I wanted to point out, that&#8217;s the vertical heading levels menu. When you insert a heading into the block editor, you get a list of levels, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6. Now you can have, the heading can now be vertical. I think it&#8217;s by default vertical now instead of horizontal as it was before so it only covers a certain different amount of content when you have the toolbar right next to the block. It&#8217;s quite nice to look at that. You just go with the mouse pointer up and down instead of left and right. That was a bit ….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. I think initially in the first release it was also vertical, but then, at that point, there were only H2, H3 and H4 options in the menu so it was short and it was quite easy to &#8230; on the visual level it would look better, but then you had six options like right now and there was also text for each of them. It just was too much to see H1 and heading one, this is why those iterations were applied now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. It also came from the query block, when you have other, not only the heading block but also the post title block or the archive title, then the context of that menu was a little bit different and you were covering up too much of that query block that you tried to template things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Right, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. That was the other part. The heading is now multi-usage so to speak and not just a mere heading block. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski: </em>Yeah. The last item is a very important one. I hope that&#8217;s not the case for our listeners, but if you are using WordPress 5.6 then the Gutenberg plug-in won&#8217;t be supported anymore in that version. You need to have at least WordPress 5.7 to be able to still use the Gutenberg plug-in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> To use the newer version of the Gutenberg plug-in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: In general we recommend using the latest one because that makes everything so much easier, but we also know that, when there&#8217;s a new major version, some sites cannot be immediately updated. We wait for one more major release, but in the future we consider that this period of time would be shorter, maybe two months, three months, something like that. It also depends on the major release cycles. Now this year we have only three major releases. The plan initially was to have four. That wouldn&#8217;t be that much of an issue. With three releases it&#8217;s just too much time when we have to support code that is no longer necessary in the plug-in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. To make this specific, if you are on 5.6, only Gutenberg plug-in until 11.4 will work with your WordPress. You can use the plug-in but you won&#8217;t get the updates after, unless you upgrade to the next version, 5.7, in your WordPress. I don&#8217;t know if I made it clearer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t want to test that, but &#8230;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well if you have any questions, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Encourage everyone to stay on the latest major version which is 5.8.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes, 5.8.1, yes. All right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was the Gutenberg 11.5 Changelog. It&#8217;s quite an interesting mix on that, but most of them are design tools and theme related and some of them are related to some blocks and also for the content creator flows. It&#8217;s a nice release again with a lot of people bringing &#8230; we have quite a few new contributors now on the Gutenberg repository which is a nice change.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we are coming to the section of what&#8217;s in active development or discussed. Because it&#8217;s so &#8230; the next big thing that comes into WordPress is the navigation block and screen, or that&#8217;s what everybody&#8217;s hoping. Daniel Richards posted an update on what are they working on. Of course it&#8217;s slow progressing and they&#8217;re migrating the navigation editor, I mentioned it before, to the REST API. Those changes have been merged and it&#8217;s all updating now. Lots of UI changes that are working now, the top bar, the editor top bar being updated, the main block inserter added and then fixes for the block styles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I can put the important part, good discussion is on the way, he writes, on how to provide backwards compatibility for custom fields on existing menu screens. That covers the part where now the plug-in advance custom fields has a section where you can augment the menu, in the classic menu, with additional fields and additional information. The discussion on that issue is how far should that &#8230; the team works under the assumption that it needs to all be backwards compatible and it&#8217;s the issue &#8230; if you want to follow up and not go to the show notes, 31551 is the issue with the navigation screen menu items custom CF options. There&#8217;s a discussion, Elliot Condon, the lead developer on the plug-in, is in the discussion as well, so help make this, we need you to also chime in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then what they&#8217;re working on next is that they want to have &#8230; in the current editor, menu editor you can say, &#8220;Okay, give me all the posts or all the pages.&#8221; You&#8217;re bulk adding links to your menu, that&#8217;s still in the works for the navigation screen, the block-based navigation screen and also to have theme JSON controls to configure the navigation block further. That still is in the works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> It sounds like a lot of work to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Those all &#8230; yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. I&#8217;m sure all of those tasks are in progress, however to take them to the finish line is going to be quite a huge challenge because we have four weeks between go/no-go dates, so it really depends. Also I could envision that the new navigation block would be included in core but maybe not the navigation screen. There is a lot of ways to proceed in this regard. Let&#8217;s see how it works. I hope that the screen will be enabled. Opt in is the only option they consider, similar to the widget screen, that you need to enable yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Yeah. I think so, especially with the backwards compatibility. These menu plug-ins that are out there, it&#8217;s not only the advanced custom fields plug-in that modified the menu pieces or menu entity or the link entity in the menu screen or menus, there were other plug-ins, albeit the Mega Menus, albeit some others. They need to be backwards compatible. Oh, the other part was naming menus. When we build sites we sometimes have a footer menu, a header menu and a main menu and we need to name them and make them available to pull in into any other screens there and make them available for full-site editing as well. There are a few things that this powerful feature in classic WordPress, it&#8217;s hard to reproduce it and be as flexible as it is now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Okay. That&#8217;s all about the announcement. I just wanted to remind that I&#8217;m taking time off. Unfortunately that coincides with the next Gutenberg release. Together with Birgit we decided to skip recording in two weeks. We cover two Gutenberg plug-in releases in one episode and that should be available for you in four weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s right. We will take a break from the podcast. I hope you are subscribed to the newsletter of the Gutenberg Times so you can still get some updates in between, or just visit the website in between.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the end of the show I want to remind you that there is actually a live Q&amp;A coming up on October 7 at 16 UTC, 11 Eastern, when we discuss the building, going from building classic themes to building block based themes with Ellen Bauer, Carolina Nymark and Andres Norén. We will entertain you there and answer all your questions. I&#8217;m thinking I will ask them to actually stay for, instead of 60 minutes to 90 minutes, because we will have some demos and we want to make sure that we answer all your questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be a link on the homepage of the Gutenberg Times and of course we will have it in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, the show notes will be published on <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/\">GutenbergTimes.com/podcast</a>. This is episode 52. If you have questions or suggestions or news you want us to include, send them to <a href=\"mailto:Changelog@GutenbergTimes.com\">Changelog@GutenbergTimes.com</a>.

My handle is G-Z-I-O-L-O. You, Brigit, is B-P-H, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right. Right. Well I say thank you, Greg, Grzegorz, it was again a great pleasure talking to you. I wish you a wonderful vacation in Greece. Until the next time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Thank you, Birgit and our listeners for being with us. You, Birgit, I wish you a pleasant flight back home. See you all in four weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> All right. That&#8217;s it. Thanks for listening.

In today&#8217;s episode we&#8217;ll talk about Automattic becoming a sponsor of Gutenberg Times and the Changelog, theme.json, Gutenberg 11.4 release and a lot more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator of the Gutenberg Times, and I&#8217;m here with my co-host, Grzegorz Ziolkowski, JavaScript developer at Automattic and WordPress core contributor. Hi, Grzegorz, how are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I still feel energized and extremely excited after all the big news shared this Monday in the context of the Gutenberg project. Maybe you should speak first. How have you been lately? Has anything interesting happened?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. That&#8217;s funny. Yeah, it&#8217;s been a wonderful week, though.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I have fabulous news and some of our Gutenberg Times subscribers already know that. People who follow me on Twitter know this, but I&#8217;m thrilled to announce that on Monday, August 30th, I started as a developer advocate at Automattic. Grzegorz and I have been co-workers for five days now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yay! Congratulations. I can&#8217;t think of anyone else who fits better for this role.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, thank you. You&#8217;re too kind. Like many people who responded and shared on Twitter, many are podcast listeners, as I said, and I was overwhelmed by all the kindness in the WordPress community. Thank you to everyone. Sometimes Twitter really shares its love and I took it all in. Well, it was overwhelming, and a lot of people have reached out. And so thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Automattic is now main sponsor of the Gutenberg Times, the Changelog podcast, and our live Q&amp;As and my work working on it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being part of the WordPress developer relations team feels like coming home to me. And I&#8217;m deeply grateful for Automattic for offering me that position. The best is yet to come for Gutenberg and publishing with blocks. I&#8217;m elated to be part of an astonishing team that takes the worldwide WordPress community to the next journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yes, so I&#8217;m really glad that you will be able to dedicate 130% of your work time to help people to get to their next level when hacking with Gutenberg. And I&#8217;m highly impressed with what you were able to achieve as a volunteer, in addition to other duties that help you to pay the bills. So I can also imagine how much of an impact it will make on the community now. I said there is more news to share. What else has happened?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, on Monday, Frontity announced they joined Automattic too. So Grzegorz, can you describe what Frontity framework is, and how this fits into the Gutenberg roadmap?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> So for those who don&#8217;t know Frontity, it&#8217;s a &#8230; how they call it? Server-side dynamic framework for headless WordPress sites and blocks. So in some ways, it&#8217;s similar to Gatsby for those who know the space of headless or decoupled WordPress. The biggest difference is that Gatsby, it&#8217;s a static site generator, which means it generates HTML files, JavaScript files, and it just runs on your server, so you don&#8217;t need Node.js server, whereas Frontity uses Node.js.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it allows you to create a sort of front-end theme that is for WordPress, and that&#8217;s run in Node.js. And it uses the content you create including the content with blocks, and it adds some additional functionality to it like nice page transitions. It adds some dynamic features like for images and there are plugins that can apply some changes to that so it&#8217;s really interesting. And the best thing here is that Frontity as a framework, in their announcement post, they said that they are planning to pivot their efforts to WordPress core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes, but so Frontity runs in ReactJS too, right? Not only Node.js but ReactJS, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski: </em>Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, no, that&#8217;s awesome. So Matias Ventura, he&#8217;s a member the developer experience team at Automattic and lead architect at the WordPress Gutenberg project. He wrote that, &#8220;I&#8217;m really impressed with the effort and care the Frontity team has put into the work over the past few years. We are at a cusp of exciting new opportunities for Gutenberg and I cannot wait to start collaborating together on making the experience of developing with it a joy to behold.&#8221; So that sounds like a great pivot for Frontity to just be a framework to actually bring everything into Gutenberg, as you said, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. So I see it more like they bring their experience. And they will try to replicate some of great ideas they had in the Frontity framework, and find ways to achieve the same goals inside WordPress core, which would benefit so much bigger audience. I&#8217;m thinking about developers, but also for users on the WordPress. And I&#8217;m also beyond excited about the plan they outlined in the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they said that, &#8220;Automattic offered to sponsor our team to work directly on the WordPress open-source project, and in particular, to contribute our expertise in developer experience, front-end tooling, performance and user experience to the WordPress core itself.&#8221; So this is exactly what I just said. And actually for me, who is focused around experience with building blocks, it&#8217;s really great how this expertise can bring the project to the next level, and our efforts to making full-site editing so performant and optimized for bringing only the assets you need, bringing what&#8217;s missing the most now is that the block editors is focused on the WP Admin but on the front-end side, we need more interactivity and more better experience of global sites, the first step but Frontity bringing their own experience can fill the gaps in other areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah. And I have seen that there are also developer relations people with Frontity, so I&#8217;m glad we will definitely be able to learn from them. What I missed early on was talking about the developer relations team. It&#8217;s actually now a band of five with Anne McCarthy and Daisy Olsen being there for almost over a year just wrangling the whole thing by themselves. And then Tara King was joined, and then Ryan Welcher and myself, so we are band of five.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think there are two people coming away from Frontity, but I&#8217;m not quite sure yet. We haven&#8217;t even as a team yet have &#8230; because we&#8217;re all new. So we&#8217;re all in support rotation right now at Automattic and at the WordPress forums. So I think next week is going to be the bigger week where we&#8217;ll co-organize everything a bit better. Yeah, so but there&#8217;s exciting news for the future of Gutenberg and there&#8217;s also some good news for some other site owners, agencies and developers. The WordPress core committers officially extended the support for the Classic Editor plugin all through 2022.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives everyone another year to migrate to blocks. Josepha Haden Chomphosy wrote, &#8220;Still, if you have been putting off using the Block Editor, this is an excellent time to give it another shot. Since it first appeared in 2018, hundreds of WordPress contributors have made a lot of updates based on user feedback. And you will be pleasantly surprised how far it&#8217;s come.&#8221; Of course, most of our listeners know that, about all the huge changes because we haven&#8217;t been shutting up about them. But it&#8217;s definitely an interesting year now for the Gutenberg project and migrating to Gutenberg because all of a sudden, it has a much better picture of the final version or the final vision. Not the version, it will never be done, but yeah, final vision.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also, now that quite a few APIs are settled, there is a great creativity amongst developers and we&#8217;re going to talk about it a little later in the show. But on the WordPress Tavern, Justin Tadlock also interviewed core committer, Jonathan Desrosiers. And he had some more details on their approach towards maintaining the plugin beyond 2022. So we will share that link in the show notes like we will all the other links in our Announcement section here, that&#8217;s now quite big. Yes. Anything to comment there, Grzegorz?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, I mean I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if there were listeners of this podcast that still use the Classic Block plugin. And this is mostly because you might have a site that is no longer developed and it just doesn&#8217;t make too much sense take therefore to migrate that to blocks. So there are always use cases like that. So I&#8217;m really happy that the support is extended. But eventually, I think that it would be good to say that it&#8217;s only a plugin. And if you want to, just keep it installed, and the community should take over the effort, because it&#8217;s a lot of work to keep it up to date. And it&#8217;s not something that we want to have forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, and funny, you mentioned that. I have quite a few sites, and it might surprise everybody to hear that, quite a few sites that are actually on Classic Editor. We have taken them over about two years ago or some of them three years ago. And the theme is that Franken theme, like where all the plugin functionalities within the theme. And then there are plugin that we could build and separate out. But the theme, it does the custom post types, and then relies heavily on advanced custom fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even they have a blocks kind of building thing, there is no migration work done between former advanced custom field sites to migrating to blocks. That&#8217;s one thing. I own this one site where there are thousands and thousands of posts on them that there&#8217;s no bulk, reliable way to migrate those over. One site is so old, or that was designed in 2012. So it&#8217;s not even responsive now, or the responsiveness is kind of really clunky, but the content creator has used a lot of HTML tags within his postings. And it&#8217;s an elaborate layout. Making that into Gutenberg blocks is very, very, very hard. But those are the projects I will be handling sooner or later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, there is a good reason to stay in Classic Editor for another year or two or three. But yeah, you&#8217;re right. Once in a while, it&#8217;s probably needs to be taken over by the community. And there are actually a few plugins already in the repository that go a little bit further than the Classic Editor. One of them is by John Starr, and it says Disable Gutenberg. And it also covers the classic widgets section from that. So yeah, just a little side note, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> One question.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> So why don&#8217;t you stop upgrading WordPress, like keep it on 4.9 and just take the security updates? Isn&#8217;t that the best option to feel safe about the future of the site?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, I think sooner or later that most people would actually appreciate Gutenberg as a user interface and getting block patterns rather than a section of, I don&#8217;t know, two pages of ACF Meta Boxes and they don&#8217;t have a clue how it looks, as long as they don&#8217;t hit preview and see how it looks on the front-end. And so, I think the advantages of using Gutenberg for even a big site that has a lot of layouts would be even better. So a migration sooner or later needs to happen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, not only for that, but also we have new editors come online, all the knowledge is kind of outdated, or they see it on other sites. And that&#8217;s a WordPress skill now, to work with Gutenberg. And now they come to a publication that doesn&#8217;t use them, it&#8217;s anachronistic. It takes the fun out of it, pretty much. It takes the fun out of me when I need to use the Classic Editor because, &#8220;Oh, it would be so much easier to do it in Gutenberg and we can do so many more things.&#8221; So sooner or later, we need to think about migrating these large sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. So I guess the reason is that you want to stay with the latest WordPress to get all the updates and make sure that the plugins are still compatible, and they also get updates, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, I mean, it makes a lot of sense. I&#8217;m just mostly curious.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, no, I totally get it. Yeah. Especially that-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, I guess we can move on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; I think we have to otherwise we&#8217;re getting a little long, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> We can move on to Community Contribution. So I only wanted to highlight two full-site editing themes that I found out about recently. One of them is called Frost and the other one is Aino, I don&#8217;t know if I pronounced that right. And they are very interesting. And we&#8217;ll leave the links in the show notes as usual. And one of those themes had a very interesting idea because it was like a master theme that had a collection of block patterns.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s like you have many different target groups in one theme, but you can select that through pattern, which is pretty interesting idea. It&#8217;s like a sort of block patterns directory inside the theme, which is something new. I like those explorations in the community that happen right now with all the new possibilities. So Aino is also targeting e-commerce websites. So that&#8217;s also quite fine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So Aino has been built by Ellen Bauer and Manuel Esposito, I think, the theme developer shop out of New Zealand. And Ellen Bauer was already part of our live Q&amp;As talking about full-site editing early on. And Frost WP is the full name of the site, frostwp.com, started by Brian Gardner. And Brian Gardner has been around the WordPress community for ages. He was the original founder of the Genesis framework, which was then sold to WP Engine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he has started now, with the full-site editing in mind, a new theme base called Frost WP. So both themes are not done by new people. They evolve their own coming from the Classic theme going into full-site editing theme and going in full speed. So it&#8217;s really exciting to see them grow and work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, pretty inspiring to see those full-site editing themes growing. And I also wanted to report that I did my homework, and I caught up with the new Tell Me About Blocks podcast, which is hosted by Michael Schneider. I guess he&#8217;s from Germany, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I think Australia, but I haven&#8217;t done my homework yet. I haven&#8217;t connected with him yet, which will happen. Michael, if you listen to this, expect a ping from me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, so if you look for inspiration how to build blocks, or extend their capabilities inside the WordPress Block Editor, then I strongly recommend listening to both published episodes. I enjoyed the one with Rich Tabor a bit more because he has outstanding experience in the field and he profoundly understand the project&#8217;s visions. So I wouldn&#8217;t feel comfortable saying that he&#8217;s a representative of the Gutenberg core team and put him on the spot and talk about Gutenberg. He deeply understands how it all should work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, and I followed Rich Tabor from the beginning of his CoBlocks plugin that came out quite early. He built it with Jeffrey Carandang together. Listened to him at the Boston WordCamp in 2019. And he had some great philosophical ideas on how to build blocks in terms of what needs to be in the toolbar, what goes into the sidebar, and how to approach metadata and options data that need to be built into the Block Editor as well and how to handle those.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it was quite an interesting way. So he publishes also on richtabor.com, with blog starts about theme.json, about his experience, and what he thinks how everything should work and how it works.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 5.8.1 RC</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, this brings us to our What&#8217;s Released section, and we have a release candidate for WordPress 5.8.1. And it was released two days ago on September 1st, and it has 41 bug fixes to core and about 20 bug fixes to the Block Editor. Although there are 20 release pull requests as you mentioned before we started recording, Grzegorz, not all of them are part of the bug fix. Some of them are just PRs that need to be added so the other PRs would work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, so Gutenberg developed so fast that we introduce some technical changes that just are related to, let&#8217;s say, code quality, and then it makes it difficult to backport the actual bug fixes. So that&#8217;s why it took 20 commits, instead of let&#8217;s say, 10 or 15.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So we will share the show notes to the release candidate post on the core Make blog with all the track tickets and PRs that went into it. The release date for it is September 8th, unless, of course, any additional fixes to be made. But that&#8217;s expected to be Wednesday, September 8.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Gutenberg 11.4 Release</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we had Gutenberg 11.4 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Finally.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Finally?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Finally, the Gutenberg plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, do you want to start out with what the most important things are?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: It&#8217;s one thing that I marked like we said and big font is the change that converts the Gallery block to use Image block. So it&#8217;s a concept of having composed log of several blocks, I mean, two blocks at the moment. So this change is still behind an experimental flag. So you need to go in the WP Admin to the sidebar. And there is Gutenberg, and there is Experiments page, and you need to mark the checkbox and save the settings to enable this new version of the block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several reasons that were covered with the dev note that we talked about, I guess in the last episode. We will include the link to the dev note. This change is planned for inclusion in WordPress 5.9. So we encourage all the block authors and theme authors to check out this new version, because there will be some incompatibilities. It&#8217;s mostly because the markup has changed, and it might break some CSS styles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also some plugins that do transforms between Gallery blocks to something else or vice versa. So that needs a lot of testing, it was tested extensively already, because it&#8217;s a huge change, which brings a lot of opportunities. And the best way to check it out is look at the release post for the Gutenberg plugin, which shows that demo, and it&#8217;s really nice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It shows how you can move images, you can change every individual image the same way as you modify a single image. So, that&#8217;s a great way. You can use drag and drop now inside the Gallery block. It&#8217;s just an excellent change. And of course, the plugin authors can do any change they wanted. Usually they can allow you to use other blocks inside the Gallery block, it&#8217;s very exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, it&#8217;s totally &#8230; I love to see&#8230;. I have experimented with it a bit. And yeah, I like that you can have a different style for each image. So you can have rounded corners for one and circles for a speaker list or something like that. Or each image can have a separate URL now. So when you do a speaker section, that each speaker gets its own link to the profile or the session; just thinking about online conferencing right now, I guess. But it&#8217;s really exciting to see how that works.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually tested this PR a couple of months ago. And I was really amazed how it worked quite well with some of the plugins that you mentioned, Grzegorz like CoBlocks Gallery, or others that had a gallery modification. The three ones that I worked with, were quite compatible with it. I know that Glen Davies, who spearheaded the refactor of the Gallery block also did additional testing with that. He tested them with the Jetpack blocks and Lightbox for the Default Gallery &amp; Image Block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I mean, he also made a point in testing the three default themes, as well as Astra and Arbutus. So it&#8217;s all in the developer note that he published and which you will find a link in the show notes as Grzegorz said. Yeah, but I&#8217;m really excited about this. I think this is such a great way to put a huge photo gallery together and make it work on a website, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, and just to add more, so now in the Gallery, you can apply image editing, so you can crop the individual image. You can add duotone effects. It&#8217;s so powerful because of this change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And all you learn with the Image block, you can certainly apply to the Gallery block now. And you don&#8217;t have to use two different ways on image handling. So that&#8217;s definitely an advantage of reducing the cognitive load and expand the horizon a bit. Yeah. So what else is in there? Good. All the next things seem to be like an anticlimax to that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But the Cover block now; you can allow an alt text now for your Cover blocks, which is a great accessibility necessity. The Block Lists is now improved, the iframe block, patterns and template previews. So it&#8217;s easier to see what you&#8217;re getting when you go through the list. What else?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> There are a couple of changes to Post Featured Image. So it was pretty basic before but now there is support for duotone. They added the scale property, so which allows you to change how this Post Featured Image is displayed inside the block. And as far as this Post Featured Image can fit to the space it has, it can be somehow like constraint and something like that. So there is some contextual help now added to make it clear what it does, really. And there is now, for other blocks, there is font weight support that was added to several blocks, like Post Date, Post Terms, Site Tagline, and the Button. And yeah, basically, it&#8217;s a constant effort to add those features to more blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, to add more controls to more blocks. Yeah. So I think what I learned with Gutenberg was that well, first, one block gets an extension like the font weight controls, and then once that is finalized, it will be replicated for the other blocks, or other blocks get the support for that, and then it&#8217;s tested, how that would work out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I really like that to kind of have additional testing in there before it&#8217;s rolled out to all the blocks. Yeah, and that way, the Button block received the spacing support that uses axial padding. So you can have also horizontal and vertical padding for the buttons now within your Buttons block, which is a feature that was requested quite a bit for Gutenberg. And because many, many block suites actually had that built in almost from the beginning, but so now it&#8217;s in core. Yay!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> So this is&#8230;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, mark, also some changes, because we have those editor feature preferences. And they were reimplemented now on the Widgets page, on the Site Editor page, on the Post Editor page and now they are extracted. And the idea is to have one common interface to use on all screens and share the logic. So that needs to be tested by all the users because there might be some bugs. I would expect that because there is some technical challenges in how to migrate that and store it in the browser. So when whenever you refresh the page, you have still the same settings, they are stored in the local storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> When you talk about feature preferences, do you have an example of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, sure. So when you open the more menu like the one on the top, on the right side, and then you have fix my toolbar to the top, disable the full screen mode, and things like that, so some of them are present on all screens, some of them are specific to the given screen, but the code that powers that is now in one place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, okay. So for all the three editors, it&#8217;s all at one place. And if you change it for one, you know where to change things? Is that answer the past or it&#8217;s now getting closer to thinking about taking those preferences out of local storage and put it into user metadata or is that still a ways off?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Oh, this one is actually in progress for two years or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right, right. But I can understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> So we are aware about this limitation. So the first exploration was to use cookies. And because there is some API already that uses cookies in WordPress. However, cookies have limitations in the browsers. In some of them it&#8217;s four kilobytes and in turns out that it&#8217;s not enough for the settings that we want to store. So yeah, there is a REST API-based approach that is close to land, but it never happened. And definitely….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; No, I can see why. Yeah, I can see why it didn&#8217;t happen. Because the editors&#8217; screens were not yet finalized. Because many people knew that there will be a Widget screen, there will be a Navigation screen and then there will be a said editor screen. And the other preference were not yet settled completely over all for different editors. So I can see why it didn&#8217;t happen. But it was also not kind of clear to me that that&#8217;s the reason. Yeah because-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> &#8230; It&#8217;s also complex from the user perspective because now it&#8217;s the question. So now, you said that you don&#8217;t want to have full screen mode. The question is, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t want to have it only on one of the screens or it should be applied to all screens?&#8221; And now we have it in one place, we could consolidate that and give this option that this option should apply to all screens. But that would now like these user-experience questions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s also other questions. So once you pick something; now I am on the mobile that have a small screen. Do I want to have fullscreen there, or it should apply only to the desktop? So there are so many combinations that make it really hard to build a good API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; Yeah. I imagine. And there&#8217;s also the question, &#8220;Okay, if we do it for our editor team, but when I&#8217;m an administrator, do I want to change that setting again?&#8221; Yeah, that&#8217;s another level there. So I can see why that hasn&#8217;t been finalized. But then if you really want to have your editor screen, I don&#8217;t know what Marias Jensen does, he has this plugin where he stores these kinds of preferences, actually, in the user database, how he manages that. So it&#8217;s interesting to see, yeah once that&#8217;s explored, where it goes. But for this release, all things are now in one interface package. So that&#8217;s a big start in that direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, but the changes are applied per screen. So when you change the&#8230; what is it, your toolbar displayed, it will only apply to the given screen for now. But in the future, it has to be decided and we are looking for feedback. So new listeners, if you want to chime in, just open an issue and propose how you would like to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I like that. This brings us to the Bug Fix section, and there were quite a few small bug fixes. We are pointing today to the design tools section, which fixes a bug that now allows zero values for those theme.json styles. So the theme.json style generation. So, a quick side note. I had a conversation with a Jason Crist, who is on the theme team at Automattic and he said we need to make a more a &#8230; he didn&#8217;t say we need but I learned that it might be helpful to say, JSON, when you mean the JSON file, and Jason when you mean the person named Jason. It&#8217;s really hard to do this, or you change your name to JSON, like Jason Bahl did, the WPGraphQL plugin developer. Anyway, so what&#8217;s up with zero values in the theme.json styles?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> So global styles it&#8217;s like a new specification of CSS written in JSON. And you know that the issue was that it was possible to write the string 0px, like pixel, but when you were providing a number or the string with zero, it would filter it out because JavaScript or PHP would consider it empty. And so, they fixed that and those values are also allowed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So like I could open that I don&#8217;t want any gradients by adding the gradient but leave the array empty and it would actually disable gradient?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Maybe, I don&#8217;t know about that basically. But for the field or property, it was quite important. To have padding equal zero is quite common if you don&#8217;t want to provide the unit all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Mm-hmm. Excellent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Performance</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us to the Performance section of the changelog, and there is one that now provides a batch function to the data module to batch actions. I recognize the words, but what does that mean?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> It&#8217;s like there&#8217;s a new API in the WordPress data package that allows you to combine several actions, which means changes to the state of the application. So that prevents that on every change, you would have re-render of your UI. So it just waits until other actions get applied and then sends the signal, &#8220;Okay, components, you can check out for changes now.&#8221; So instead of having several renders that most of them would be wasteful, it just waits for the better time for do it. And it&#8217;s pretty common technique that I&#8217;m surprised we didn&#8217;t have it before. And all agreed about that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah. Okay, good. And does it add to performance gains?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, on the PR did. However, when I looked at that post and the metrics chart, at the bottom of it, I didn&#8217;t see any differences. So it&#8217;s really hard to see impact of one PR, because there are other that could downgrade the performance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Good, excellent, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> In theory, it should make a difference when applied on a larger scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> All right, now you&#8217;re going to take us into the Experiments?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Experiments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, I can talk about some of the experiments because I developed two of them, I guess. And so one change that we are looking into is when you have these blocks, like Gallery is now a good example. When you turn on the experiment, you have Gallery block and an Image blocks. Sometimes, you go to the Image block, and you just want to apply something to all blocks like let&#8217;s say, there&#8217;s some alignment option in the Gallery block you want to take the space of the full canvas, or the&#8230; how it&#8217;s called, a full and wide, or like regular. So it&#8217;s like going back and forth between parent and child block, it&#8217;s pretty annoying.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is that you could do two things. One is dock the toolbar that it always is anchored to the parent block. The toolbar is always displayed in the place when you have the Gallery block. When you enable this option, then the alignment would be also actually shared with the child block. From the child block, you could change the alignment or alter the Gallery block. And yeah, this is something for the toolbar control that is already in place. It&#8217;s still experimental. We are looking also and adding the same functionality to the inspector control, so all the controls that are in the sidebar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, there were also new refactoring to bring their groups. So that is also interesting from the plugin author&#8217;s perspective because if you have more structured way, then first you will be able to target those groups to insert your controls. At the moment, you can either add it to the general sections like next to all other controls or to the advanced one, which is pretty limiting. And in the future, we think that there will be a lot of groups that have more structured way of handling those controls.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One exploration is to add dimensions control so I can see a follow-up with the typography or colors. It&#8217;s a better way to have these controls distributed and the user experience also would be better because you could easily remember where to find something. And that also brings another possibilities like very frequent requests from the site owners to disable some of the controls, and we don&#8217;t have controls over third-party changes. So you could at least disable the group now, and that would be a great way. And usually, that&#8217;s what you want instead of doing granularly, just tell that this group shouldn&#8217;t be there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> No, it&#8217;s really helpful to have the single block also be part of the parent block toolbar to control those properties over all their child blocks, that&#8217;s really great. The next part was the blocks spacing. Now the global styles also have a block spacing gap configuration that you can control through the theme.json file. And it also adds support for the layout to control the gap between blocks. Tested out, global styles are still in the experiments as well. So you need to switch them on. But it&#8217;s getting really interesting now that global styles is prepared for 5.9. It&#8217;s not clear that it will be in 5.9. But we want to definitely test all those things for the user controls, and especially also to switch off user control.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to the Documentation. There were mostly minor changes to the handbook, but one item got me excited that says, &#8220;Alphabetize the glossary entries.&#8221; Especially from a higher-level point well, there is a glossary. I looked at the PR and it&#8217;s actually the glossary on the core contributor&#8217;s handbook that has been alphabetized. So if you ever want to know what a committer is or what CRUD means or what a dev note is, the glossary, and I will put the link into the show notes, so you don&#8217;t have to dig it out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, you can look it up there. It&#8217;s quite extensive, and I really like it. Now it&#8217;s alphabetized, so you might as well find stuff. Of course, for the alphabetization to work, you actually need to know what the name of the thing is that you look up. So it might be worth reading through the glossary from A to Z is probably a good way to expand on that. Yeah, anything else in that part that you want to point out?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Code Quality</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> No, no, in fact, in the Code Quality section, that is next, there are eight items. But those are also some minor changes that I didn&#8217;t find anything to highlight.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tools</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> All right, that brings us to the Tools section. And there are quite a few PRs that have the same beginning, and that is, &#8220;Automated Changelog&#8221; and I&#8217;m really happy about that, because we go through the changelog, and if it&#8217;s well organized and structured, Grzegorz and I, we can really work through this quite easily. So you have been working with people there as well or was it somebody &#8230; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, that was quite a nice team like Dave Smith, Hector Pietro, myself, and Dan Richards. So yeah, we teamed up and everyone contributing in some way. So now the changelog you see in the release post, and also in the show notes we share, it&#8217;s mostly automated. So that&#8217;s very exciting that you can see everything in this form now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Excellent. Yeah. And then there were some changes on the GitHub contributor template, that the form to fill out an issue has been simplified for the bug report with a form template, so you can lead along and don&#8217;t miss any information. So it short-circuits the communication line. Once you report it, developers don&#8217;t have to come back and ask you for additional information. So filling that out is really helpful and speeds up the process. And you don&#8217;t forget anything when you fill out the bug report.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. It&#8217;s a nice change from GitHub, that they provided a way to make this process more like filling a form. So it&#8217;s much simpler from the user perspective because they know what they have to provide rather than skipping the previous version, and everyone just ignore most of the points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; Yeah, yeah. And it&#8217;s easier, you don&#8217;t have to remove stuff from the issue template to get it all fixed up. Yeah. No, really good work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, there&#8217;s one more change that I personally find very interesting. So whenever you have a block is parsed, then if the contents saved in the database no longer matches how the block should be represented in the post, there are some deprecation logs in the browser&#8217;s console. Most of the users they don&#8217;t see, but it&#8217;s important for developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it was after we introduced block patterns that they don&#8217;t get updated after they&#8217;re created, usually. So those logs started to pollute those browser consoles. So now, they are grouped together. Especially, it&#8217;s important when everything went well, so you don&#8217;t really have to report that however we do that for the information of the developers, maybe they want to update that. That&#8217;s a good reminder, but….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah. I can see that the block patterns of course, changed all the time, even in the content and going back to the block patterns, not the same original. But I think that whole process is also a major pain point for developers to get into block development using JavaScript. The deprecation process per se, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s unstable or it&#8217;s just very verbose and laborious. I know quite a few developers have decided to just use PHP for the rendering, and not go through JavaScript for the render, and create dynamic blocks, quasi-dynamic-static blocks, so to speak. And looking is going to be helpful, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> In this context, when you are using Cover blocks, and they get new features, and because of that, it requires new HTML markup to represent that, because you have those deprecations encoded, whenever someone inserts the button that was created two years ago, when you insert that into your post, you would get the most up to date version of that block, which is what we want to achieve and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important. Of course, when you are working on a site that you have different needs, then dynamic blocks is probably something that you want to have, however, in the context of using patterns, that has some downside when it&#8217;s dynamic because you just need to have something that you&#8230;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah. Totally. Yeah, definitely. So there&#8217;s also one, well, pain point with that to just kind of surface it a bit more is when you have a changed block, the deprecations does not kind of go back to the block that was used two months ago and had a different HTML, it just does not recognize as a mistake, but it does not update the block, or the render or the content that was built with the block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that&#8217;s was also something that it&#8217;s hard for a developer to&#8230; or it was hard for me to figure out, &#8220;Okay, I built this block. And now I make an update and a new version of it. But all the previous usages of the blocks are not getting updated.&#8221; And that&#8217;s how you do when you have server-side rendering, it always uses the latest codebase for that. So, that was an interesting problem that surfaced with the JavaScript blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, I know we deal with those issues all the time when we update the markup. It&#8217;s just the most painful&#8230; Also, for a core developer, believe me, it&#8217;s not simple, but the benefits which I covered are more important in this context.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> All right. Okay, so what&#8217;s next on our changelog? That&#8217;s it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> It&#8217;s kind of related.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, no. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. So in this section, What&#8217;s in Active Development or Discussed, we have a very interesting debate on the internet. It&#8217;s still related to building blocks, but from the different angle than we covered in previous episodes. So it all started with the tweet from Mark Jaquith. And so, he poses the idea, as he explained, &#8220;What if building custom blocks for the Block Editor was as easy as supplying attributes and a block of HTML? What if this produced React-editing code and PHP-rendering code without a build step?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s just magic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Magic. There was also a code snippet shared which was like a PHP class that had those attributes and a function that renders the aforementioned HTML. It&#8217;s a pretty nice idea. That&#8217;s funny because Riad was almost at the same time working on a prototype of something similar. And he shared his explorations on GitHub in the new repository he created there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the idea is almost the same. But instead of it using PHP, Riad asked, &#8220;Well, what if you use something that&#8217;s platform agnostic in a way that it doesn&#8217;t bound to a certain programming language, but something that we could use in PHP in JavaScript, but also in React Native or in any other languages you want?&#8221; So I really like how this discussion has developed. I also talked to Riad about his idea.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He walked me through, and it&#8217;s really interesting what he does is he just implements what Mark said. So he uses a JSON file. And in this JSON file, he also represents HTML, something sort of like HTML code, that then gets converted with the tool that he created into PHP, JavaScript and CSS that&#8217;s just represent your block. Yeah, a bit mind-blowing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, he calls it Blocky, and we&#8217;ll share certainly the link in the show notes that&#8217;s on GitHub, for youknowriad&#8217;s user base kind of forward slash blocky. It&#8217;s not an automatic thing or something or a WordPress thing. But yeah. And then there was another discussion. I think there was this discussion was between Mark and Helen Hou-Sandi as well. Yeah. And what does she tried to do? She blogged about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, the idea was just to start discussion and set a good tone. I think that she shared also an example using Mustache-style tokens, which is something well known. It&#8217;s used in other projects like WP-CLI but also in Gutenberg in create-block tool. Yeah, but she does make the clear that it&#8217;s not about this particular templating system or the way it should be done. It&#8217;s more general. It&#8217;s like an example to better visualize the ideas.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yes, I like the discussion, where it&#8217;s going, and the ideas that pop up. And there was also a comment from Lars Gersmann. And he said, &#8220;What if you would use pure ES6 template strings for rendering the components?&#8221; So it&#8217;s like just another way of represent. And this one is pretty interesting because people don&#8217;t like JSX when building blocks, which is a sort of another templating system to represent a code.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in this context, there is something built by Jason Miller from Google. And it&#8217;s called HTM, and which basically, is something that some people use instead of JSX, which doesn&#8217;t require build step. So having this representation, of course, in PHP it doesn&#8217;t look so promising in that context. However, if you would have this templating system and a way to integrate that with PHP, you could do really interesting things. Like in JavaScript, you wouldn&#8217;t need a build step, you would just write this string as something that resembles HTML and it magically would convert to React components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m glad that now those conversations happen. But I think it also needed to have much advanced &#8230; you couldn&#8217;t have that conversation three years ago because you wouldn&#8217;t have the APIs in place to even do a proof of concept or kind of push it a little bit further. And so, it&#8217;s clear that that needs to have mature APIs and additional experience to push this a little bit further and make it more open for different variations to build blocks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pascal Bichler also chimed in. And he had this additional approach to saying, &#8220;Okay, using React components in the editor, but use web components that use the same API to render the front-end.&#8221; So it sounds like duplication, but on the other hand, web components are maintained by a large standard body and are not dependent on the implementation of the framework, like the React framework, or you can use web component with other frameworks as well. So if you would change the &#8230; God forbid, the editor to a different component system, you still could use the same front-end. That&#8217;s kind of interesting way to &#8230; that&#8217;s a larger look at things, way larger than I&#8217;m capable of, but yeah, it&#8217;s just another way to organize things there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, it aligns with what Mark proposed, to have one our presentation don&#8217;t get like, it behaves differently in the editor, differently on the front-end. But maybe it could be different if you are in a native app, on your phone, it would could have a different representation. It&#8217;s very interesting times to be in and engaged in those type of conversations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, for some who do day-to-day development, it seems to be more an academic discussion. But I think it would be really helpful to read Helen Hou-Sandi&#8217;s blog post, and of course, we&#8217;re going to share it. And she made a big point of saying this discussion is not between two WordPress core committers, like Mark Jaquith is and she is. She has been a lead developer for quite a while on the open-source project. This is just a discussion on programmers who do agency work to organize how they do custom blocks within the team.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that certainly, should be interested to some of the agencies that also work with us and have been on the fence of using Gutenberg or have tried to solve some of the problems and to get additional input from those that Helen Hou-Sandi works for 10up and Mark Jaquith is, I think, a freelance developer. So from their point of view, it&#8217;s definitely worth a read.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. If I look through our notes here, I have just one thing that I wanted to point out that is Matias Ventura, who is called the spark of Gutenberg in one of the publications, posted a short blog post, but it&#8217;s giving the theme.json file its horizon, pretty much. And he covers there when themes are going full-site editing, or using the theme.json file for controlling all the different places of the theme, it has some consequences on interactivity because you now can build an interface on top of it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On consolidation, you can remove the overhead of repetitive declarations about block features, and then compatibility, that language of blocks is by default compatible with third-party blocks, which I find is a quite compelling argument to switch over to theme.json because the plugins then also can connect with the theme and be more&#8230;. We talked about it, Grzegorz before here, that if you have an additional custom post type or a different content that you want to put on the front-end, you can tap into the theme.json to style i, or keep it in style with the local theme without having to do a lot of your own CSS put to it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It definitely has a performance gain on rendering those block themes and starting to roll out them. And it has a flexibility component to it, a visual parity. Talking about patterns, he talks about portability, accessibility, and also the admin section. So it&#8217;s quite an interesting post to look at from a bird&#8217;s eye view on the theme.json and what it will mean for WordPress and WordPress development. So that&#8217;s my before you go, end of the show thing. Do you have anything that you want to point out, Grzegorz?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: No, I just wanted to emphasize the portability that we also discussed in the context of blocks, it&#8217;s just the same. How much this would change the landscape that you could have this meta language that allows you to write blocks that can be run in so many different places, not only inside the WordPress web app, but also on mobile devices, and in so many other places like in Drupal or whatever the future will bring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, so I was wrong. I have two more things that are I wanted to just point out before we end the show. First&#8230; Oh, it&#8217;s actually three, no five&#8230; I never stop. Okay, so let&#8217;s wiggle that down. It&#8217;s Anne McCarthy has published the summary of the testing call for the header and the navigation block. It&#8217;s very interesting, the summary will be shared, but it also points out some of the pain points that still need to be resolved with navigation block and the screen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then speaking of theme.json and portability, she is preparing with a team, also the next call for testing, which is not so much a testing of features, but a testing of a broader picture. And that is how themes switching will work or was supposed to work or what&#8217;s expectations about it? Because that&#8217;s certainly something would be relevant when we go into 5.9, or when it&#8217;s released, could be 6.0. But how does theme switching change now with theme.json and full-site editing? Meaning which of the templates that I as a user build, I want to keep when I switch the theme? Or is there a header that I want to keep when I switch the same kind of thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how that&#8217;s supposed to work and that will be really great if you&#8217;ll have a lookout, we probably will talk about it at the next show. And then this third one, what I wanted to do is&#8230; And I totally forgot about it. So this is the end of the show. Yeah, no, it doesn&#8217;t come to me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So thank you so much, Grzegorz. It was a great show again, and we got some very interesting technical insights in how to approach some of the harder work at developing Gutenberg. So I think that was really helpful for me, especially, I learned a lot today. And then as always&#8230; Sorry, go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> It&#8217;s always good to discuss those difficult topics, but it&#8217;s very inspiring, also to see how the community explores all those ideas, so I&#8217;m glad to follow all those discussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So as always, the show notes, and they will be quite long, will be published on the <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/\">gutenbergtimes.com/podcast</a>. This is episode 51 and if you have questions and suggestions on any of it, please send them to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. That&#8217;s changelog@gutenbergtimes.com. Well, thank you so much, Greg. It was good talking to you. And thank you to our listeners for being with us.

Today, we will talk about the preliminary roadmap for WordPress 5.9, the Gutenberg 11.3 release, and the navigation screen and block, and so many more things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times, and I&#8217;m here with my co-host, Grzegorz Ziolkowski, code wrangler at Automatic and WordPress co-contributor. Good morning, Grzegorz. How are you? Thank you for agreeing to record this early and accommodate my in-laws&#8217; schedule. It&#8217;s fabulous weather for a bicycle tour tomorrow. So we&#8217;re doing it today. How are you?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Hello, Birgit. I&#8217;m great. It&#8217;s Wednesday, and we are before the official release of the Gutenberg plugin, but it looks like everything is ready. We are recording anyway. So the weather here is similar. It&#8217;s maybe not for bicycles for me, but there&#8217;s a lot of activities outside. I hope to play basketball in the evening with my friends. So that&#8217;s great, as always.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes. Physical exhaustion in the heat. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> In fact, the weather is great, because it&#8217;s hot during the day, but the mornings and evenings, they are quite chilly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, that&#8217;s awesome. Yeah. Good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So first, we have some, I mentioned it, Matias Ventura published a preliminary roadmap for WordPress 5.9. Now, that 5.8 is out with some of the full-site editing in there, some block designs, block patterns, he has some thoughts on what needs to happen for the next release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His post divides up the work in six sections. We&#8217;re just going touch briefly on it, but do chime in Grzegorz anytime. So the first thing he mentioned is blocks and intrinsic web design, that he feels that the responsive tool, and of course not only he feels that, every theme developer feels that, that the responsive tools are still missing for blocks. And that needs to be addressed in regards to intrinsic web design, which is an evolution from the responsive designs and is about page layouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he considers, three context matters is really the point here, that if a block isn&#8217;t displayed on screen, or on the phone, it still needs styling to consider the context. So it would be displayed as an inner block in a column display. It definitely also needs a different styling than when it&#8217;s in a single row by itself. That needs to be addressed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I looked up the expression intrinsic web design, because I wasn&#8217;t all that familiar with it. It was quite….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I don&#8217;t know that one as well. So I&#8217;m curious to hear more about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And it was coined by Jen Simmons, she brought the grid layout to us as a responsive design plus, and it&#8217;s fixing some of the shortcomings and hacks of the responsive designs. Without going any deeper, and here a couple of years ago, she did a great talk at the Event Apart, and we will have the video link in our show notes about that, where she breaks down how we address a flow layout or flex layout, grid layout, and then so forth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s definitely something that needs to get into the Gutenberg blocks, now that we are approaching page layouts with the site editor, there needs to be done some more work, as Matias says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> In terms of technical aspect, is it less about using media queries to style your website and more about to make the design change according to the space it has? It&#8217;s more based on what&#8217;s the neighbors of your block, if it is something that is in the column, then classical media queries wouldn&#8217;t work because it&#8217;s still too narrow?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> That makes a lot of sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And the viewpoints, of hard coded viewpoints that you see in a lot of designs, they not always apply, because the tablets get bigger, the phones get bigger, the phones get smaller, and then you watch it on a big screen, which is beyond the normal computer screen. The context changes so much on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that there are brilliant people in the Gutenberg team that can address it, but you needed to have the whole thing. I hear the rumblings that a developer needs to override the block, or a theme developer needs to override the block styling to get it into his own theme displayed nicely and all that. That is all part of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the whole context of a page layout wasn&#8217;t yet clear how the column block or how a cover block with multiple inner blocks would be handling that. That&#8217;s certainly a problem to have and to be solved. I think that&#8217;s what I learned from Matias&#8217;s post, it&#8217;s very, very high on the priority there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also comes in with the panel directory now, that it&#8217;s available now, it needs to have a better integration with the inserter. And also get some multi-block transformer improvement, that you can transform maybe a cover block into a block pattern or a paragraph block or a quote block into a block pattern. And that flow also needs to be integrated into template parts and page layouts to add block patterns into those.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, I guess the most important part is that some of the block patterns that are in the directory aren&#8217;t so easy to use, because you need to copy them. I hope to see some improvements on that side. I guess that&#8217;s doable. It&#8217;s not that far away from that place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And the meta team and the Gutenberg team worked on that already with the block directory, where you can search for a block in the inserter and then grab it and get it into your content. I think some basic architecture was already done there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> But it was only for a subset of blocks that were marked as core specific. So that&#8217;s a different story to make it work for everything that is sent to the directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, the directory itself, the pattern directory right now only allows for core, for patterns that are built with the core blocks. It&#8217;s a similar process, there is no danger that the block that&#8217;s in the pattern wouldn&#8217;t be on the site. Well, unless it&#8217;s switched off. Yeah, there&#8217;s a block manager that it switch off&#8230; That&#8217;s definitely some issues that will need to be solved one way or other, or it will bubble up as a bug later on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third section that the Gutenberg, it is the navigation menus that will be the main focus for 5.9. It&#8217;s the new navigation screen as well as within navigation blocks. And there are definitely still some experience and display improvements necessary and reduced complexity was an expression that Matias uses in his post. And also that definitely needs to be tested, tested, tested, with as many themes as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which, and you will hear me talk about it today multiple times, is that there is already a testing call. Anne McCarthy already posted the ninth call for testing for the full-site editing outreach program, and that is actually covering headers and navigation. We start with that already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fifth one, section four, Ventura&#8217;s roadmap or WordPress roadmap then is creating an interface for the theme JSON file. Right now, writing theme JSON manually in code is tedious. And the next step is to actually finalize the UI and the whole system is, we talked about it before, we covered it under global styles, where the user gets the chance to set those theme settings and configuration with the interface in a sidebar, in the site editor, that is also coming to 5.9. And the team has been working on that for quite a bit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fifth one is header design tools, colors, typography, spacing and layout. And one of the main goals would be a consistent access to the similar tools across blocks, and including third-party ones. And that the parameters and the settings are normalized between block JSON files and theme JSON file, when there&#8217;s block support or theme support, that they use the same taxonomy there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> We had a lot of experimental features enabled in 5.8. I hope all of that is going to be stabilized, and we will have a consistent API. We are on a good path towards this goal. I&#8217;m positive about this one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And there&#8217;s a lot of testing also done, actually, I think Anne McCarthy also published a survey, we will highlight in the show notes, the results of it, where they connected with some theme developers on how they are using the theme JSON and what they liked and what they don&#8217;t like. So that is also great input for that phase of preparing for 5.9.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sixth section in Ventura&#8217;s roadmap 5.9 post was to formalize the editing flows for block themes and having a clearer information architecture for all the features, like editing templates, styling pages, creating whole template parts and all that. There was some great input from the full-site editing outreach program. So that will be iterated a lot, and also finalize the theme level blocks that have been experimental or have not been published for the&#8230; They&#8217;re in the plugin, Gutenberg plugin, but they&#8217;re not in WordPress core yet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that concludes the preliminary. That&#8217;s a very big word there, roadmap for WordPress 5.9. The schedule is not out yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, I guess the original plan was to have the release in December this year, but I don&#8217;t know, there isn&#8217;t a very detailed plan about that. So still probably involves and we will learn about that soon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I&#8217;m thinking the core meeting later today would bring another preliminary schedule there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so if it stays with the schedule for December, then there will be future release in October, eight weeks before the release. That&#8217;s only two months away. So that&#8217;s a big roadmap for that. I&#8217;m sure there will be a cutoff date where we say, &#8220;Okay, this comes in or it doesn&#8217;t come in, or it&#8217;s ready or it&#8217;s not ready,&#8221; like we had it for 5.8.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a few community contributions today, we want to talk about. First, there is a new podcast. It&#8217;s called Tell Me About Blocks. And it&#8217;s an interview podcast about building extensions for Gutenberg, the WordPress block editor. And you can learn from guest experiences, creating block plugins, themes and block patterns. Michael Schneider is hosting that. It&#8217;s a monthly podcast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So July was the first episode and was with Keanan Koppenhaver. He&#8217;s a WordPress contributor and agency owner and plugin developer. He talks about his experience to do the Block-a-saurus plugin, which he just played around with the block editor to make it a little bit more fun. He&#8217;s also the maintainer of the Kanban for WordPress plugin that&#8217;s in the plugin repository.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second episode, Michael Schneider interviews Rich Tabor, and talks with him about the making of the latest plugins, Markdown Comments, and the to-do list plugin for the block editor, which are more collaborative plugins for the admin section of the editor, rather than for front end. I haven&#8217;t listened to the second one yet. Have you heard about it Grzegorz?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I only learned about this podcast yesterday. I subscribed. So I&#8217;m planning to listen to both episodes, because this is the area I&#8217;m the most interested about, in the development of the block editor and WordPress in general. I&#8217;m looking forward to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talked about the contributions from Rich, in particular about the markdown comments block, and the path, the journey that he had to send all his work to the block directory. So I&#8217;m just keen to learn more about the process and the experience in the form of the podcast that we all love, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, and so we wish good luck to our fellow partner, Michael Schneider, in Tell Me About Blocks. And you can read up about it, tellmeaboutblocks.com. It&#8217;s all one word, no dashes, no underscores, anything, tellmeaboutblocks.com. So you can subscribe to yourself, because you are listening to our podcast, so you are interested in podcasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a second announcement in the community contribution, which is from a team, of the WordPress team from the learn.wordpress.org team. And Hugh Lashbroke and Courtney Robertson have a proposal for brand guidelines for the Learn WordPress content. They asked plugin and theme creators if they want to contribute a course to the site. And the proposal handles the brand guidelines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if there is, how they will handle shoutouts to other products that are outside of wordpress.org, but in the space. I think that should have your attention, and read through it and see what you think about it. Because definitely, the training team could use some help from more practitioners. It should be worthwhile for the brands as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> And we need more tutorials how to build for the block editor, how to use the block editor. It&#8217;s all there, but it&#8217;s rapidly changing. We need to record new content. It&#8217;s only in your hands, and we are waiting for that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. You make some great impact if you contribute that way to the WordPress project, and it&#8217;s what you already know. So you don&#8217;t have to learn a whole new thing. But you can influence millions of WordPress developers who wait for your wisdom.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 11.3</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us to Gutenberg 11.3 release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski: </em>It&#8217;s still not out at the time of the recording. But we hope that it happens in any hour today. And anyway, we can cover what&#8217;s already in their release. This time, there isn&#8217;t anything in the changelog that would be marked as a new feature, although some of the enhancements listed are in the space of something that could be considered as a new feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is now a new color picker, an experimental component. We talked before about this project, that has this code, G2, like next generation of components. And the work is towards building a better UI for all those controls that you use with blocks, with global styles and such. And it&#8217;s still experimental. But the plan is to have different color pickers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can check out this work to see the difference that is there and if you like it or not, give some feedback. It&#8217;s still in the works, in development. So you have impact on that and can drive the future work on that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The G2 initiative is to make components much more accessible out of the box, so to speak, that a developer who uses those components, not only the Gutenberg developers, but also plugin developers and external developers can use those components and have an accessible experience, a more accessible experience out of the box. At least that was the new initial focus from Q and Sarah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> And in general, there&#8217;s more to it. This concept of intrinsic web design, this is all about making this new set of components that they follow those principles. They adjust according to the context.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the other part is the team that is behind that. They are trying to unify the public API. At the moment, we must admit that some of the components were created a long time ago, and they were more like a realization of the current needs than the vision for the future. But this project helps us to bridge that gap, and make it much easier to use for all developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, thank you. So one of the enhancements is also the post featured image block received basic dimension controls for the image, which was something that was requested quite a bit. And that is when you use the query loop block or the post template, where you display the series of blocks and the featured image with it. You can also use it in the single post template, if you have a block-based theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, so just to remove some confusion that we discussed before the recording, is that this feature doesn&#8217;t quite work with classic themes. So it doesn&#8217;t have any impact on post featured images, unless you start using block-based themes, and all those designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I think we need to, some of the enhancements that you said, we need to point out that this is not for classic themes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> And there&#8217;s also a small change, a visual change, there are new icons for usable blocks and template part blocks. This is a special type of box that store the content in the database, and in the past, we had this logo looking like a Lego block. And now it looks like a stacked diamond. And the difference is only that one of them has the filled in background color, or something like this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a subtle difference, it shows that those two blocks are similar, but a bit different, the usage is different. It&#8217;s more for design and usable block is more for sharing the same content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And the stacked diamonds represent that it&#8217;s more a block collection than just one block. So the reusable block are the ones with just the outline of the stack diamonds, and the template parts display is the filled in stack diamonds. And you can distinguish them in the list view of the site editor or your post editor to identify them better.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I think that was the main motivation, because the list view is now persistent. When you have it opened, those visual cues are really important.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The next item is for the block editor. Now, for the internal links, there&#8217;s also the rich previews enabled. So when you link to a post that&#8217;s on your own site, once you did the linking, and you come back to that post and hover over it, it gives you a nice little window with the title, the featured image and an excerpt. And it also gives you a little link where you can unlink that post again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is similar to a Google Doc linking mechanism. It really speeds up the quality control of your content when you go back and double-check on some of the links, is it really the right post and all that. And it takes care of, it uses the meta description and the Open Graph meta tags for that rich preview. So if your site doesn&#8217;t use those, you won&#8217;t get the rich previews, and it wouldn&#8217;t show. But most WordPress sites use them out of the box anyway.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I think it&#8217;s a game changer for content creators. I use this command plus trackpad click feature to check if the link that I used is correct one. You no longer have to do it, you just hover over the link and you have the hint for visible at your….</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing is that the button block, it has now padding block support. This one is quite different in how it has changed, because it&#8217;s not only a new feature that was added to the sidebar, but I think this is also the one that introduces a bit different UI experience. Is it this one or did I miss that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> No, it&#8217;s the next one. But this one is the padding. Now, padding has been around for quite a bit, padding and margin for cover block. And now it also comes to the button block. So it&#8217;s the sub block of the buttons block, where you can set the padding for all buttons or for the whole dimensions of the button, like the padding 20 and it adds them to the top, to the right, to the left and to the bottom.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you can unlink those sections, and then individually change the top left, right and bottom padding, as well as the padding for the button. You were talking about the next piece, there was the dimensions panel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Dimension panel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s interrelated, because the new dimensions panel, it&#8217;s using two features, it&#8217;s controlling two features, which one of them is the padding and the other one is margin. The idea is that, with so many new controls showing up, for some blocks, it&#8217;s too much to process when you look at the sidebar. So there is this exploration that is already in the Gutenberg plugin, that allows you to use the drop down menu to pick what&#8217;s displayed inside the panel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can decide whether you want to display both the paddings and the margin or only one of them. And there is also this reset all feature, that just goes to the default state. So according to the discussions that are in this PR, you can find out that this type of interaction is considered for all other panels like typographic and color.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to how it changes, because it&#8217;s something that site owners requested for so long, to have better control over those features. Once we have that, apply to all features, it will be much easier to give also some coding APIs that will allow to control that from the code, so you could easily turn off all the features you don&#8217;t want to have on the side.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And it&#8217;s also part of what Matias mentioned before in his roadmap post, that the consistency of having the controls all look alike. So once a user learns them, he can apply his knowledge to all kind of different places where that control can be used. And also how to handle a margin that is now different from a cover block to the theme parts sidebar. So that&#8217;s part of this normalizing and being more consistent in all the tools.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those are the enhancements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we have a few bug fixes. There are quite a few bug fixes in this release. I just wanted to highlight one of them, that is that the custom gradient picker for left to right languages is now fixed. So now gradients work well, better again, from left to right languages. I&#8217;m a fan of gradients and everybody should have access to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> It&#8217;s definitely a very nice feature. And there&#8217;s other bugs I want to mention in the template editor. And now, we show only post template actions for user with correct capabilities. So sometimes those features are very powerful. So you want to have better control who can access them. It&#8217;s something that is constantly looked at and improved. There&#8217;s so many new features added, it&#8217;s very easy to miss that part, that there should be permissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, this alleviates some of the anxiety that theme developers have, that any user can mess up their beautiful theme with changing some of the templates. But it&#8217;s now only restricted to the admin. That angst can be alleviated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Performance</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There were also quite a few performance improvements that come with this Gutenberg release 11.3, and one of them is the lazy render block types in the inserter. It only shows block types that are necessary now. Have we talked about it before? I think that is an additional iteration of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> It might be something different. As far as I remember, this one is the same solution that was used for block patterns. So block pattern does the previews and so on. It&#8217;s a lot of data to process. There is a special handler that just splits the list of all block patterns into chunks, and this solution was implemented also to the block inserter and improved the performance, like perceived performance of the inserter immensely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the difference you can see is that you will see small parts of the block types in the inserter at first, and the rest will just be iteratively added as the browser has free cycles to process that. So that makes the experience &#8230; because you can already start processing the block items in the inserter as they are rendered. In the past, you would have to wait until everything is ready. That&#8217;s a big improvement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So what I see in that PR is that Riad created a little page or website that measures the block editor performance and it&#8217;s titled, Is Gutenberg Fast Yet? I think we talked about it before.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And where he sees the different items, how much time they use. And so he does some incremental improvements there and highlights all the different things that are keeping Gutenberg from being fast. It&#8217;s quite interesting for those who are interested in that kind of analysis, look at the PR in the site, and maybe you can help him figure out some of the performance hogs to make it even faster.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, also, speaking of Riad and all his efforts to improve the performance of the editor, he also posted on his blog, about the cost of WordPress lag is on the performance of the editor. So it&#8217;s a really good read, especially if you are one of the authors of blogs, and he just shows the results of measuring the impact of the most popular plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, he covers the plugins that add the functionality to the blocks, like additional features and how it impacts the performance. He covers also some recipes, how you can measure it on your own, when you are developing. The state of major plugins is really good, it has improved. As he was preparing this post, he reached out to some of those plugins, and they improved the performance, based on his findings. So it shows how the community is really into these performance improvements. That&#8217;s really great to see how it evolves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recommend checking out this post. He shares his approach how to process all that. There is also, it&#8217;s a follow-up post, because in the past, he had another post when he explained all the impacts of different approaches that you take when building blocks, using data stores, using rendering, and it&#8217;s very complex.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are really into block development, those two posts is definitely a must-have, if you want to provide the great experience for users, because performance is one of the most important aspects of that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>I&#8217;m just scrolling through that, thank you very much for pointing out this post. I haven&#8217;t seen that yet. So definitely, we will share the link in the show notes. And it&#8217;s definitely an eye-opener in how plugins change performance. And he has some nice spreadsheets there, where you can look things up, and also how you can, as you said, how you can measure your own as well, if you develop a plugin for that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, thank you. It&#8217;s also improved performance through the parser of removing the automatic custom classnames handling. What does that mean? I&#8217;m not so quite sure I understand it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> It&#8217;s quite complex. But the difference here is that this was the responsibility of the block editor before, and Riad moved this logic to the block parser. It&#8217;s happening earlier in the process. And because of that, it allows to skip some of the….</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases, when you have the classic block or you have the HTML, I don&#8217;t remember, other blocks, you know that for some blocks, you don&#8217;t have to do this processing, because they are not using this automatic classname handling. So you can skip that, that&#8217;s one improvement from start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also this ensures that the logic is executed only when really necessary. So when the block is valid, you don&#8217;t have to run that at all. But with the previous solution, it also was always applied. It had a really big impact when the post was really big.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it&#8217;s very technical, and it&#8217;s something that a small group of people can really help with. But Riad, he&#8217;s just the king of performance. He knows who to do all this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> He loves to hear that, the king of performance. No, but it also shows that it only can be an iterative part that you can get it perfect, and you can get it to be more performant after the fact.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Experiments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to the experiment section of these release notes. It will highlight the template part placeholder now when you create a new template part with the site editor. So experiments has the full-site editing in there, and the navigation screen are the only experiments right now in the Gutenberg plugin that you have to switch on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The site editor itself is actually already switched on. I don&#8217;t know why it&#8217;s still in the experiments there. But when you create a new template part, say a header or maybe a sidebar item, it now asks you for a title as well in the create flow. So you don&#8217;t get as many untitled template parts as you got before. You can think about the title right when you create it. That&#8217;s definitely a improvement of the flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, I also hear that the template part is going to be promoted to the stable feature. So it means that will be included in WordPress 5.9, for sure. And maybe that even will happen in the next plugin release. So, 11.4. And that&#8217;s great, because this is a very exciting feature. It will open a lot of possibilities, even for classic themes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, and now that it&#8217;s coming out of experimental means there are more eyeballs on it, to test it and to figure out what needs to be changed, or if it needs to be changed and what bug fixes are there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the navigation link block, that&#8217;s a child block of the navigation block, now actually also has the ability to remove a link, which is certainly in the process of creating a navigation, a useful tool. Now, it&#8217;s there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I think that brings us to the documentation section. And there is one item I wanted to highlight. Because we have those block patterns that you can search from the block patterns directory. And of course, some site owners don&#8217;t want to have them. So now there is a document explaining how you can disable that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That part was missing, but it was possible from the release, WordPress 5.8. So it&#8217;s now covered. If you don&#8217;t like that, you can check out how to disable that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, as any WordPress feature that is new, not only needs a way to enable it, it also needs a way to disable it, to make it as flexible as possible for all the WordPress instances that are out there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us, so there are quite a few other smaller changes to the documentation that you can check out for yourself, because they are just changes to existing documentation pages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Code Quality</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Code quality, there is one highlighted that is the remove of the experimental prefix, and rename the theme JSON files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re theme developers, you now can remove the underscore, underscore experimental prefix on your theme JSON files as well. It will not read anymore from the experimental theme JSON file either.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yes. And there is a small change in the API. So in the core data, there was a method to get authors, and it wasn&#8217;t very flexible. But it&#8217;s now deprecated in favor of get users, that allows you to pass the flag to return only authors. But also, it has a lot of other features that makes it better use. So it&#8217;s only changed to consolidate the API and make it easier to discover.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Excellent. Thank you. Do you want to go through the tools section?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tools</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> There is one big change in that regard. So there is a lot of complaints about build tooling. And you related to that, because I was one of a few folks that were involved in updating Webpack to version five, and it was a pain. We started the first try in January, I guess, but it failed because of several issues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now we finally made it, and it&#8217;s going to be&#8230;. So the change is in the Gutenberg plugin already, and it has a good impact on the bundle size. It has decreased. It was 30 kilobytes or less that&#8217;s going to be sent to the user, which is a big win. So yay for Webpack 5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> But there&#8217;s more to it. This change will also be applied in the WordPress scripts. We should expect NPM publishing for this package later this week. And so basically, if you are using default config files, everything should be good. If you are using your own custom config, then if you want to upgrade to the latest version, be prepared for some troubles, because it isn&#8217;t easy. Webpack isn&#8217;t backward compatible, to the degree that the WordPress is. It&#8217;s just what it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, as we say, there will be dragons.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> For sure, if you have a custom config, it&#8217;s not easy. I&#8217;ve been there already. And the next step, of course, will be to do the same update in WordPress core. There&#8217;s three places to update. I understand the frustration from people who try to use those tools by themselves. You have a lot of courage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Testing</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And then there&#8217;s one other features that we will highlight from the testing section. And that is that the mobile team added a guide for integration testing, if I say this right, and it turns out to be quite complex.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, in general, we talked a lot last time about the barrier of entry for developing for WordPress. The way to start, even writing tests for the mobile apps is just on completely different level. It&#8217;s like a skier wrapper or something like that. It&#8217;s just so complex.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess this shows how the, not new web, but how the world evolves. You no longer only care about the browser, but there is also the phone, the tablet, and building apps for that. So if you are curious to learn how you could contribute to the native apps, if you are interested in this type of development, that&#8217;s definitely a good way to check and play with all those tools and see how complex the setup can be, if you are going outside of the web bubble.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I&#8217;ve never really ventured into the native apps development. But I had hoped that React Native would be a path to go. And then I read, oh, by the way, this brings us to the end of the changelog. And we are now more in the section of active development, what&#8217;s discussed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And we will share a post to Matt Chowning that he wrote about building an editor by sharing code between Android, iOS and web with React Native. It only brings you so far to reuse code base. And it seems that the mobile team recreated some of the Gutenberg experience, recreated them from scratch, reusing components, but not reusing some of the code base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s quite an interesting read, finding out how complex that whole thing is when you do it through a phone screen and operating system.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, but the good point that the team, the WordPress mobile team is very happy about choosing React Native, and they emphasize that the speed of development is really good, because they can share the logic part of the editor that is developed for the web version. All the JavaScript code, they can reuse, and they don&#8217;t have to write it from scratch.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what&#8217;s even more important, whenever there is a performance improvement, they get the same improvement on their side. And also, from my perspective, whenever they find something that is not working properly, they contribute back, so all parties win here. That&#8217;s the beauty of that setup.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And everybody benefits from that. The mobile version is also part of the overall Gutenberg GitHub repository. So there is some synergy there as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So two weeks ago, there was this big discussion about barriers to entry. And in our weekend edition, 180 and 181, on the Gutenberg Times, I shared quite a few blog posts and discussions on podcasts about that topic. So if you want to dive into it some more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Justin Tadlock from the WordPress Tavern, interviewed Matias Ventura, the Gutenberg Project lead on that. And it&#8217;s an interesting read, in that regard, that it really depends on the knowledge of who is developing for the web. And it&#8217;s a different perspective from someone like me who started with HTML, where only HTML was around. And it took about a couple of years before CSS came in. And then it took another couple of years before I needed to write some early JavaScript.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I only had to add one little thing to my whole toolset. But it was also the speed of things. But latest in 2004, &#8217;05 or &#8217;07, I was left behind on all the cool development. And now caught up with it through WordPress, because that&#8217;s when we started, in 2010, we started with WordPress. And it took me about five years before I even had to touch code on a WordPress install to make a feature work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it really depends on where you come from. I jump from a ColdFusion development base to a very rudimentary PHP, to good JavaScript knowledge. The barrier is different for me, from someone to build a plugin, from someone who has 10 years of PHP experience and knows all the intricacies of WordPress, because for 10 years, she has been developing in that space. So that&#8217;s one thing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Matias also points out that the theme creation, and the new on ramps for theme developers is so much lower than it was the last 10 years for theme development in WordPress. Because now you can start with the block-based templates, you can do block patterns, you have the theme JSON to control some of the features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you could basically write a new theme without touching code, because the site editor gives you all the tools with it, or at least that&#8217;s the vision in 5.8. The 5.9 will come close to it. And then with patterns, you can account any theme in any case very easily with just assembling a few blocks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also mentioned &#8230; go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I think it&#8217;s very interesting to hear the vision from Matias, because he also shared this preliminary scope for WordPress 5.9. He knows what&#8217;s the end goal. And that&#8217;s much easier to see the landscape, how it will look in a few months when you will be able to fully benefit from all the latest development in the space of block themes. And that&#8217;s one way of looking at that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I think that in general, if you look at the development for the web 10, 15 years ago, you didn&#8217;t compete with mobile apps, and they didn&#8217;t exist at all. Everyone was using Nokia or other phones that only allowed you to play Snake or something similar, that was it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the mobile apps, tablets, they change the perception what you can do, how you interact with those devices, and all the gestures and stuff like this, and animations and the performance. That was so much better because it uses some native technologies. So if you combine all those aspects together, it&#8217;s really hard to tell that the development should be still simple and the barrier of entry should be simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It cannot be, because we have so much bigger expectation as users these days. So of course, there are some libraries that help with that, but exploring the libraries, finding the right one and integrating that, it&#8217;s another level of complexity here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I also think there&#8217;s a level of decision paralysis, because if you have too many choices on the libraries, the chance that you pick the wrong one is really high. And then for some people, that is an existential decision. And if your business depends on it, it makes it an existential decision that a lot of other people depend on that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can see that, but it&#8217;s not only WordPress. All we know is WordPress, but it&#8217;s in all the areas that are out there that develop for the web.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Go on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, all I wanted to say was, when I look at what all needs to happen at the same time and play together, all the little pieces, it&#8217;s actually a miracle it works at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> That&#8217;s true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Because so many things could work. We should all be blessed that we actually can get something together that works well for millions of people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, I think we all were happy about the limitation of the web 15 years ago. You had the basic HTML, CSS was very basic. Now, there is CSS4. So the number of features that were added in the meantime is, scope is so gigantic, and you have to learn fifth method of positioning elements on the page. And also, you have JavaScript that has evolved, there are new features in the language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even PHP, if you look back, PHP 4 or 5, it&#8217;s a completely different language than PHP 8 that you have now with types and some strict checks and so on. And the tools that are around, that we didn&#8217;t have the interest back in the day, now it&#8217;s wildly popular. And end-to-end testing was very hard in the past. Now, you have so many tools to pick from.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s up to you what you pick, because you could still use only PHP, HTML and CSS and some basic JavaScript and that should be fine. But the question is, if users will like it, or in terms of on the front end experience. But also, if the customers for all the businesses that WordPress supports, will be still happy to continue using very simplified interface, that is very technical.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. I think there&#8217;s so many things for many people. I think we will have a link to the WordPress Tavern article with the interview with Matias in our show notes. It&#8217;s definitely worth a read. And that brings us I think to the end of the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> One more thing, definitely look out for the Gutenberg Times newsletter, because it has a lot of links to those discussions. This week, you should expect more because those discussions still happen on the web, on Twitter, so be aware and look forward to it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I&#8217;ll have those in the show notes as well. This week&#8217;s weekend edition is not going to happen until next week, because I&#8217;m still….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> A suspense, nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> A suspense on that, because I&#8217;m still on vacation and I&#8217;m visiting family in Europe. But before we end, again, please heed the call. If you have some time, heed the call to the FSE testing call for number nine, working with the headers and navigation coming to the site editor to Gutenberg. We will need your input, we need to learn from your experiences and also from your expectations. What you tried to do, what you were able to do, and what didn&#8217;t work and what you expected how it would work. I think that would be really, really helpful for the team to come out of experimental stage and get into the main plugin with the navigation screen and block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, the show notes will be published on the Gutenberg Times podcast at <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/\">gutenbergtimes.com/podcast</a>. This is number 50. We&#8217;re halfway to number 100. And if you have any questions and suggestions or news you want to include, send them to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. That&#8217;s <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you so much, Greg, for spending this morning with me.

The buzz around the next major WordPress version keeps everyone excited and alert. There is also hard to deal with FOMO*, as we can&#8217;t be at two or three places at the same time. And who has time to watch all the recordings? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, next week won&#8217;t be any different: Monday, the <a href=\"https://pagebuildersummit.com/\">Page Builder Summit </a>will start with 35+ talks around freelance and agency business their tools. <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#pagebuilder\">Below is a list </a>of all Gutenberg related talks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress teams published quite a few posts around the WordPress 5.9 release. It&#8217;s not yet Field Guide time, though. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hope, y&#8217;all have a great weekend with reduced screen time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yours, 💕<br />Birgit</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PS: The recordings of the last two Live Q &amp; As are available on YouTube.

The recording is particularly interesting for Matias Ventura&#8217;s demo of the current state of the major features: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>List View &#8211; Expand-collapse, Drag &amp; Drop</li><li>Auto-Anchors on Headings</li><li>Border support for blocks</li><li>Layout &#8211; Gap spacing, Flex &amp; Row,</li><li>Typography Tools across Blocks and styles </li><li>Full-site Editing as opt-in, beta preview. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the meeting, I heard the language shifting, in an attempt to simplify talking about the various features. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Now: <strong>Block Themes</strong> (instead of Block-based Themes)</li><li>Now: <strong>Editor</strong> (instead of Site Editor or Template Editor)</li><li>Now: <strong>Styles</strong> (instead of Global Styles) </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sarah Gooding</strong> wrote about it in the WPTavern:<strong> <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-9-go-no-go-update-all-proposed-features-are-moving-forward\">WordPress 5.9 Go/No-Go Update: All Proposed Features Are Moving Forward</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The work on WordPress 5.9 is on track with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/08/13/preliminary-road-to-5-9/\">The Preliminary Road 5.9</a>, Matias Ventura posted a couple month ago, except for the Navigation Screen, that did not get past the backwards compatibility issues. The Navigation Block as a major feature for site-building will be available for Block Themes in the new WordPress version. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about the status on the Navigation Screen and Block project, the team came together in a Hallway Hangout to discuss the priorities for the WordPress 5.9 release. <strong>Daniel Richards</strong> posted the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/10/15/summary-navigation-editor-and-block-hallway-hangout/\"><strong>Summary: Navigation Editor and Block hallway hangout</strong></a>, including the recording of the meeting. One meeting topic was Backwards compatibility with the current system for the Navigation screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The Gutenberg developers also release a new version of the Gutenberg plugin. <strong>Gutenberg 11.7</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adam Zielinski,</strong> release coordinator for this version, published the release notes: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/10/14/whats-new-in-gutenberg-11-7-october-13th/\"><strong>What’s new in Gutenberg 11.7 (October 13th)</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Justin Tadlock</strong> took it for a spin and reviewed it for the WPTavern: <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-11-7-iterates-on-global-styles-improves-adding-navigation-links-and-adds-column-spacing\"><strong>Gutenberg 11.7 Iterates on Global Styles, Improves Adding Navigation Links, and Adds Column Spacing</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Only two more Gutenberg releases (11.8 + 11.9) until Feature Freeze on November 9th, 2021. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\"><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kellychoffman\">Kelly Hoffman</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jameskoster\">James Koster</a></strong>  from the WordPress design team shared their ideas for <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2021/10/15/site-editing-ia-concepts-how-to-surface-and-access-new-features/\">Site editing IA concepts: How to surface and access new features</a></strong>. (IA = Information Architecture) <br />They wrote: &#8220;Do we want to begin down this path towards a single page app-like experience, or would it be better to keep things separate for now? It’s time to explore and design the IA (information architecture) so that we can begin to paint a picture of how we might merge this exciting functionality in to core.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can follow along the explorations via the <em>prototype links</em> on Figma. You are offered two ideas: All in one means one editor screen, reached via the “Appearance” Menu, and you edit templates, post, and pages, template parts or change the styles all on this screen that adjust for the various context.  The other idea is to keep post and page editing and site editing features separate, but surface some template parts to be reachable via the post/page editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />Example screen: <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2021/10/15/site-editing-ia-concepts-how-to-surface-and-access-new-features/\">Site editing IA concepts: How to surface and access new features</a></strong>.\n\n\n\n<p>I can see the all-in-one idea working, as it would hide the rest of the WPAdmin for the common content creation tasks, as that&#8217;s where many end users get lost or bombarded with plugins or theme upsell and update notices. I also enjoy the alternative design to the &#8220;Welcome Guide.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a quick decision to make. As the second one feels familiar, and the first one very new, I suspect my decision might be skewed by the &#8220;known&#8221; versus the &#8220;new&#8221;, instead which of the avenues makes the best sense for the End-User. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you have an opinion formed, leave a comment on the post! </em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>With WordPress 5.9 only two months away and Go-NoGo decisions made,  <strong>Anne McCarthy</strong> started a second round of collecting questions you might have about Full-site editing. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/10/13/submit-full-site-editing-questions-by-oct-27th/\"><strong>Submit Full Site Editing questions by Oct 27th</strong></a>.

However, most users will not see this screen unless they are running a block theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that the upcoming <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/first-look-at-wordpress-upcoming-twenty-twenty-two-default-theme-the-most-flexible-default-theme-ever-created-for-wordpress\">Twenty Twenty-Two</a> is also shipping with WordPress 5.9 and judging the popularity of past default themes, we can expect many thousands of users will be transported into this whole new world. For some, this might be as shocking as the launch of the block editor in 5.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a block theme is active, links to access the old and familiar customizer will disappear from the user interface. The widgets and nav menu screens won&rsquo;t be around either. However, they will still be accessible if you know the URL for the screens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We first learned this would be the case last year as part of the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-9-3-provides-indicator-of-where-full-site-editing-is-going-a-future-without-widgets-and-customizer-screens\">Gutenberg 9.3 release</a>. There is also an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/30496\">open issue</a> to ensure that the site editor has feature parity with some core WordPress settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is OK that these features are being phased out for block theme users. They were all early, disparate attempts at creating individual pieces of what the site editor will allow. WordPress is bringing all of these concepts together into a more cohesive user experience. It is a standard that contributors can continually iterate on. It will not be perfect out of the gate, but this first version in the core platform should fuel the feedback needed to improve it as more users start installing block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem presented here has more to do with the plugin market. The customizer was initially built as a theme-settings tool and has primarily been used for that purpose. But, many plugins have tied various settings to it over its nine-year history. A search for <a href=\"https://wpdirectory.net/search/01FJ2TGB2EZ4N867KXEA6TS6CJ\"><code>wp_customize</code></a> in the plugin directory pulls up over 1,400 results. The <a href=\"https://wpdirectory.net/search/01FJ34ZYJZTJ5MGNW4J82FBV4Z\"><code>customize_register</code></a> hook shows over 1,900. These are not necessarily exact matches for how many plugins actually add panels, sections, settings, or controls. However, it is an indicator that many are relying on it to present options to end-users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we are back to the question at hand. <em>What happens when a user installs a block theme, such as the upcoming Twenty Twenty-Two, while using a plugin that relies on the customizer?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It depends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some plugins like WooCommerce have already conveniently placed a direct link to their customizer panel/section in the admin menu. This will be a non-issue for their users. However, for everyone else, the customizer will seem to disappear entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />WooCommerce customizer options accessible with block theme.\n\n\n\n<p>In a matter of weeks after 5.9, depending on how quick the adoption of Twenty Twenty-Two occurs in particular, we could be looking at thousands of confused users. Of course, all of this could change in the time leading up to the release. However, this is a conversation that needs to happen now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The concern here is for end-users,&rdquo; said the anonymous questioner. &ldquo;They will be looking at knowledgebase articles, directions in plugin settings, and more indicating where to look for the settings.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least at the moment, the onus is on plugin authors to address this for their own users. However, there are multiple pathways they may want to go down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most straightforward method is to follow the lead of WooCommerce. The plugin checks the <code>gutenberg_is_fse_theme()</code> conditional (note that this <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32950\">function name may change</a>). If it returns <code>true</code>, the plugin adds a link directly to its customizer panel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Linking to a customizer panel, section, or control is simple. Plugin authors can find the URLs in the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/customize-api/the-customizer-javascript-api/#focusing-ui-objects\">developer handbook</a>. They can also just <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/2cf30b0190542ed097d0f2e9a607db10561d43e8/includes/customizer/class-wc-shop-customizer.php#L274-L289\">copy the technique</a> the WooCommerce team employed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a quick method to ensure users do not lose access to their options if plugin authors cannot make changes before WordPress 5.9 lands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long term, it is not the ideal solution. The customizer will be around for a long while, but plugin authors will need to deal with two sets of users: those running both block and classic themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because each plugin is different, solutions will need to be different. Many can simply use the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/settings/settings-api/\">Settings API</a> to build a custom options screen. If that is a workable solution, it will not matter what theme the user is running.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the reality might be maintaining two systems for both sets of users. One that integrates with the customizer and another that pulls options into the site editor. If the plugin has design-related features, block theme users will expect to see settings in the new interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the theming side of things, there should be fewer problems. A block theme does nothing with the customizer anyway. One outstanding issue would be converting starter content over, and there is an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/35680\">open ticket</a> to bring that to Full Site Editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than anything, keeping open lines of communication with users will help ease the transition. Some of that should come from core WordPress. However, many users will need to hear it from their plugin and theme developers. This might be blog posts, knowledgebase or tutorial updates, and keeping up with support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, there is the final solution, one that WordPress itself could implement. It is also the path of least resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress should automatically detect filters or actions on customizer-related hooks. This should trigger a &ldquo;customize supports&rdquo; flag and maintain the admin menu and toolbar links to the customizer screen. This would give developers some time to catch up without confusing users in the process. There might be a few false flags or missed integrations, but it should be able to effectively catch the majority of use cases.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 16 Oct 2021 01:02:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.9 Go/No-Go Update: All Proposed Features Are Moving Forward\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=124349\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:205:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-9-go-no-go-update-all-proposed-features-are-moving-forward?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-5-9-go-no-go-update-all-proposed-features-are-moving-forward\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2859:\"<p>The go/no-go deadline for deciding on features for WordPress 5.9 was set for October 12 but the conversation was pushed back two days. Today, the core leadership for this release <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/10/15/wordpress-5-9-feature-go-no-go-october-14-2021/\">announced</a> that everything in the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-9-proposed-scope-major-push-towards-full-site-editing-plus-a-new-default-theme\">previously-proposed scope for 5.9</a> will be moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can expect block themes, template and template part editing flows, the new default Twenty-Twenty Two block theme, the Styles interface, design tools, the Navigation Block, all manner of UI improvements, and pattern insertion directly from the Pattern Directory. H&eacute;ctor Prieto, who is assisting with technical project management on the release, emphasized that many of these features are still in progress:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>To note, not all of the above are currently ready, but there is some level of confidence that they can be by the time of 5.9.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>A new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/projects/62\">WordPress 5.9 Must-Haves</a> project board on GitHub shows a broad overview of the issues contributors are focusing on to get the release ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prieto also published an exhaustive transcript of the meeting. There were no strong objections on specific features moving forward but there seemed to be a general acknowledgment that some features are still in a beta state. Those present at the meeting agreed that some kind of beta label might be advantageous where users could be directed to the Gutenberg plugin for faster updates to features that are still not fully polished. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One particularly challenging feature has been navigation. &ldquo;I think from my perspective, the thing I was a bit worried about was the&nbsp;navigation menu&nbsp;flows, which I think we did a lot of progress over the last few weeks,&rdquo; Gutenberg lead engineer Mat&iacute;as Ventura said. &ldquo;And I think we need to set some good boundaries there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There has been a lot of work in also supporting sort of mega menus where you have in your sub-menus, you have images and paragraph any sort of block, which is cool. But there&rsquo;s also like the 80% of cases where you just have a few links, and we need to ensure that that experience is as best as we can make it. I think we&rsquo;re in a better place. And I think we&rsquo;ll get there.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beta 1 is expected November 16, and the official release is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-9/\">scheduled</a> for December 14.

The Global Styles system iterations continue to impress. The lighter nav experience makes adding links easier, and a spacing control for the Columns block delivered one of my oldest wish list items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Site Logo block <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35344\">supports duotone filters</a>, bringing it up to par with other image-related blocks. Plus, theme authors can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34667\">set the default filter</a> via their <code>theme.json</code> files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several other changes to love, such as the refreshed <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34712\">gradient picker design</a> and typography controls for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35324\">post navigation blocks</a>. The block alignment control in the toolbar now also displays a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34710\">&ldquo;None&rdquo; option</a>. This should make it easier for users to revert from a previous choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lighter Navigation Experience</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />&ldquo;Add nav item&rdquo; feature brings up search.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Building nav menus has consistently been one of the frustrating experiences within the block system. Iterative improvements have made it better, but the actual process of adding links has been a painful one, at least until Gutenberg 11.7 rolled out yesterday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In previous iterations of the block, users had to go through a two-step process for adding any menu item. This was an issue I called out in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/fse-outreach-round-9-building-a-higher-ed-header\">Round #9 of the FSE Outreach Program</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>This stage of testing calls for adding multiple page links as both top-level and sub-menu items. When clicking the + button to add a link, my first instinct is to search for the page itself. However, the available field is a block search rather than a page search.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In the latest version of the plugin, clicking the <code>+</code> icon allows users to directly search for or type a URL. There is no need to figure out which block (e.g., Page, Post, Custom, etc.) to insert first. This change is part of an ongoing effort to create a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/34041\">lighter navigation experience</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the link-adding experience was much better, I could not initially figure out how to add a simple homepage link without typing the full URL. Typing &ldquo;home,&rdquo; &ldquo;index,&rdquo; or a simple &ldquo;/&rdquo; character all failed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After realizing that the previous search did not work, I tried other known site pages. Posts, pages, categories, and tags all worked without issue. However, I could not pull up author/user archive URLs through the search field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is one place to add a homepage link, and that is via transforming the menu item to a Home Link block by clicking on its icon in the toolbar. Other blocks are also available for this transformation process, such as Social Icons, Site Logo, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Transforming a link to a &ldquo;Home Link&rdquo; block.\n\n\n\n<p>On the whole, this is a much-needed improvement to the Navigation block&rsquo;s user experience. It likely comes closer to hitting the 80/20 rule when deciding how a feature should be implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Create New Pages From the Link Inserter</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Creating a new page from the link popover.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The user experience for adding links has been one of the highlights of the block editor this year. In June, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-10-9-renames-the-query-block-adds-collapsible-list-view-items-and-rolls-out-rich-url-previews\">Gutenberg 10.9</a> introduced rich URL previews, which landed in WordPress 5.8. In the latest release of the plugin, developers have kicked it up a notch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can now directly <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35083\">create new pages when adding links</a>. Previously, users could only achieve this feat while adding items inside of the Navigation block. Now, it is available for links added anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mind the Gap</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom spacing between columns.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Users can now entirely control the gap between columns via the new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34630\">Block Spacing option</a>. I knew it was coming &mdash; eventually. That it took three years since the release of the block editor for it to actually happen has been painful. I was still a full-time theme and plugin developer when I added this to my wish list. Granted, CSS flexbox support for <code>gap</code> was not widespread then, but we could have still managed with old-fashioned margins in the meantime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am just happy that the long-awaited feature has finally landed. Now, I can begin phasing out the custom block styles I was using to replicate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feature works on top of the block gap feature that was first shipped with <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-11-4-overhauls-galleries-adds-axial-padding-for-buttons-and-lays-groundwork-for-global-spacing\">Gutenberg 11.4</a>. Theme authors may need to make adjustments if they have written custom code for controlling the spacing between columns.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Global Styles and Color Palettes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">There is a push to improve the upcoming Global Styles feature, which <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-9-proposed-scope-major-push-towards-full-site-editing-plus-a-new-default-theme\">could land in WordPress 5.9</a> later this year. Gutenberg contributors have made massive strides in improving the experience, building off its overhauled navigation in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-11-6-improves-the-global-styles-ui-adds-child-theme-support\">version 11.6</a> of the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most notable interface change in this release is the new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35109\">Color Palette section</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Colors panel with the Palette section at the top.\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of dropping the palette below the color options, it is now front and center. This is a feature that will ultimately empower users to customize their sites. The decision to focus on this part of the UI is welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After opening the palette section, users can edit the theme-defined colors or click the <code>+</code> icon to create new ones. These colors will all show up as options in the block and site editors.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Color palette editor in the site editor.\n\n\n\n<p>Users should also see the Layout section at the root level of the Global Styles sidebar. They can now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35241\">adjust the padding</a> for the overall site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am still running into an error when trying to adjust the typography at the root level. This was an issue I first noticed with Gutenberg 11.6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would like the Blocks section of the Global Styles panel to show the icons for individual blocks. With dozens of blocks, it is hard to scan through the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Individual block styles list.\n\n\n\n<p>Another improvement, particularly if we forego icons, would be to alphabetize the list.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 20:52:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: Yoast and Google-Sponsored Core Contributors Propose New WordPress Performance Team\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=124218\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:231:\"https://wptavern.com/yoast-and-google-sponsored-core-contributors-propose-new-wordpress-performance-team?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=yoast-and-google-sponsored-core-contributors-propose-new-wordpress-performance-team\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7043:\"<p>Yoast and Google-sponsored WordPress core contributors are <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/10/12/proposal-for-a-performance-team/\">proposing</a> the project add a Performance team to improve core performance as measured by <a href=\"https://web.dev/vitals/\">Google&rsquo;s Web Vitals</a> metrics. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Users expect and prefer fast experiences (consciously or otherwise),&rdquo; Yoast-sponsored full-time core contributor Ari Stathopoulos said. &ldquo;Research shows that fast websites can provide a better user experience, increase engagement, benefit SEO, increase conversion, and be more economically and ecologically friendly.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no doubt that users expect and can benefit from improved performance, but there are a number of variables at play in any given WordPress site. Looking purely at core performance, Stathopoulos said WordPress is not holding up to the competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Compared to other platforms (e.g., Wix, Shopify, Squarespace), WordPress is falling behind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Other platforms are on average faster &ndash; and becoming increasingly faster &ndash; than WordPress websites (see&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/55bc8fad-44c2-4280-aa0b-5f3f0cd3d2be/page/M6ZPC?params=%7B%22df44%22:%22include%25EE%2580%25800%25EE%2580%2580IN%25EE%2580%2580WordPress%25EE%2580%2580WooCommerce%25EE%2580%2580Shopify%25EE%2580%2580Wix%25EE%2580%2580Squarespace%25EE%2580%2580Duda%22%7D\" target=\"_blank\">The HTTP Archive&rsquo;s Core Web Vitals report</a>), and are actively investing in (and marketing)&nbsp;core&nbsp;performance-as-a-feature [<a href=\"https://twitter.com/igrigorik/status/1432400252305244162\">1</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.wix.com/en/article/understanding-your-site-speed-dashboard\">2</a>].&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The HTTP Archive, which&nbsp;provides a common data set for those conducting web performance research, found that only 21.5% of sites assessed have good Core Web Vitals scores as of September 2021. While that percentage has been increasing over time, competitors that are already outperforming WordPress sites are also rapidly improving their scores. Stathopoulos described it as a &ldquo;widening gap&rdquo; between WordPress and other platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main challenges is that WordPress site owners have a lot of freedom to use whatever themes and plugins they want on their sites, which makes performance tougher to tackle than the hosted platforms cited for comparison. The proposal states that &ldquo;achieving reasonable performance levels shouldn&rsquo;t be plugin territory, but part of core&rdquo; and that end-users should not be expected to become performance experts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Achieving high levels of performance requires technical considerations to be &lsquo;built-in&rsquo; across the whole stack; and as this is often not the case with themes/plugins, performance solutions are limited to &lsquo;brute-forcing&rsquo; performance solutions over non-performant behavior (e.g., output buffering),&rdquo; Stathopoulos said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal drew a strong response from contributors, SEO consultants, and representatives from hosting companies, offering help and suggestions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress lead developer Mark Jaquith, who has a particular interest in this topic, said the biggest issues he sees today are related to frontend performance and the asset pipeline:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>WordPress has no (direct) support for deferring style loading. It has no system for critical theme styles. For&nbsp;JavaScript, it has no support for&nbsp;<code>defer</code>,&nbsp;<code>async</code>,&nbsp;<code>type=\"module\"</code>, or&nbsp;<code>nomodule</code>. The default is to load all scripts in the&nbsp;header. WordPress itself shoves its extra code for emoji and the&nbsp;block&nbsp;library into the header. WordPress injects&nbsp;JS&nbsp;code and styles that eschew the asset pipeline altogether and directly attach to&nbsp;<code>wp_head</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>wp_footer</code>. Plugins just directly barf out bespoke script tags that are difficult to alter. By the time that you&rsquo;ve added 10 plugins to your site, your odds of having jQuery loaded (in the header) on every single page load are extremely high. No one is incentivized to be a good citizen (including WordPress itself) because there&rsquo;s always someone else who is polluting worse than you. &ldquo;If jQuery is already enqueued by something else, I guess I better use it.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Jaquith&rsquo;s summary describes a wider ecosystem problem and concluded with a sobering warning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a huge problem, and fixing it is going to take a lot of effort, willpower and time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth doing. If WordPress frontend performance continues to decline, the project is going to cease to be a viable option for any site that cares about its SERPS.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One WordPress performance consultant, Eroan Boyer, suggested adding a dedicated tool in the Site Health screen that would show how much JS and CSS is loaded on each page type (front page, post, page, CPT), and where they originated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Attributing where a given script or stylesheet comes from is something I&rsquo;ve been working a lot on in the context of the AMP&nbsp;plugin,&rdquo; Google Engineer Weston Ruter said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if the implementation in the AMP plugin would be suitable for&nbsp;core, but I&rsquo;m interested in this space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;If we can correlate where given markup comes from to the (negative) impact on page performance, then we can begin to highlight offending themes and plugins to begin to provide some accountability for what is being added to the frontend.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella published some research in August on <a href=\"https://riad.blog/2021/08/16/the-cost-of-wordpress-plugins-on-the-performance-of-the-editor/\">the impact of plugins&rsquo; performance on the editor</a>. Chief offenders among popular plugins included WooCommerce, Yoast SEO, and Jetpack. This is another aspect of performance that affects WordPress users more than site visitors. Web developer Takis Bouyouris <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/10/12/proposal-for-a-performance-team/#comment-41989\">suggested</a> the creation of a performance framework that plugin developers could follow to avoid making products that negatively impact core performance, both on the frontend and in the admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far the proposal has not received any major objections and contributors seem eager to help in any way they can. Stathopoulos said the next steps will be to set up a Slack channel, a meeting schedule, and a space on make.wordpress.org. Once the infrastructure is in place, contributors can begin benchmarking performance, defining success criteria, and identifying priority projects for Core Web Vitals improvements.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 15:24:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: Take the Guesswork Out of Selecting Fonts With the Adrian WordPress Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=123897\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:213:\"https://wptavern.com/take-the-guesswork-out-of-selecting-fonts-with-the-adrian-wordpress-plugin?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=take-the-guesswork-out-of-selecting-fonts-with-the-adrian-wordpress-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5893:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">As usual, I am always on the lookout for plugins that allow users to have fun with their websites. I like to mix it up from time to time here on the Tavern and not be all-business-all-the-time. And, that is where the new <a href=\"https://adrian.style/\">Adrian plugin</a> comes in. Its goal is to take all of the hard work out of selecting a font pairing for end-users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin derives its name from Swiss typeface designer Adrian Johann Frutiger. The plugin author, who wishes to remain anonymous, said the typographer was one of their favorites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;All plugins have such serious names stuffed with SEO keywords, and I just wanted something fun,&rdquo; they added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of the typical route of submitting it to the WordPress.org directory, the author decided to launch a one-off site to showcase the plugin. The cost runs the price of simply subscribing to an email list to access the download.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adrian is essentially a font selector. However, instead of picking each font for various theme elements, users can select from curated pairings. And, taking it one step more, it provides unique names for all of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the Breakfast Cereal (yes, that is the actual name) option uses the big and bold Luckiest Guy font for headings alongside News Cycle for body copy.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Breakfast Cereal font option.\n\n\n\n<p>If nothing else, the plugin is simply a treat to test because of its fun names. With options like Cherry Soda, Cowboy, and Hollywood Lights, it adds a little flavor to the entire process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think there are lots of people who would rather you hand them an option rather the ability to make the decisions themselves,&rdquo; said the plugin author. &ldquo;No one in their right mind looks at the 1.2K fonts in Google Fonts and says, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to pick a font pairing.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s overwhelming and out of most people&rsquo;s depth.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even as a former full-time theme designer, this could be a tedious job. I would often spend hours tinkering with pairings, attempting to find the right personality for a design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin takes most of that work and boils it down to a little more than three dozen options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a little something for everyone. For example, if you want a retro gaming feel, the Insert Coin pairing of the pixelated Press Start 2P font for headings and Roboto Mono for text can bring a little nostalgia to your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Insert Coin retro-gaming font pairing.\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin is built on top of the WordPress customizer. It adds a single section and control for selecting the font pairing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A downside to this might be for users currently running a block theme alongside the Gutenberg plugin. Menu links to access the customizer screen are hidden. However, there is still a button on the Themes admin screen, at least for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Customize button for the active theme.\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I like about the plugin is that it does not ruin body copy. Far too often, such systems try to get too fancy with text for longer-form content, and they utterly fail. Instead, Adrian keeps this in check. The fonts that veer into the wilder territory are limited to headings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin is not all fun and games. It has its serious side too. The World Literature option that pairs Vollkorn and PT Serif is elegant, creating an enjoyable reading experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />World Literature font pairing.\n\n\n\n<p>The Novella option is similar, replacing Vollkorn with EB Garamond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most irritating thing about the plugin is that it requires a full refresh of the customizer preview panel each time the user selects a new font. This is par for the course, though. Most themes and plugins I have tested for WordPress have never utilized the customizer to its fullest potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With minimal JavaScript and the <a href=\"https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader\">Web Font Loader script</a>, the plugin could load the chosen font on the fly. It would make the experience much smoother. However, because the customizer is going the way of the dinosaur, I would use my time and effort to focus on a solution geared toward Full Site Editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Success may vary from theme to theme. Typically, I use a three-font system with most of my theme design work. One font family for headings, one for body copy, and another for secondary text. While the plugin worked well enough to overrule the first two, it failed to alter the third. This is not necessarily Adrian&rsquo;s fault because it does not know the class name it must target in this instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is also the reason I favor design-related features falling squarely on the shoulders of theme authors. I like the forward-thinking of the plugin author &mdash; tackling font decisions in a way that does not overload end-users with seemingly infinite choices. However, I would rather see the system coming from the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that said, I could be singing a different tune as the global styles system matures. It has not yet shipped with WordPress, but it could land in version 5.9 later this year for block theme users. As the community builds more standards around the feature, there may be more opportunities for plugins like Adrian to add features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin author is not quite ready to go that route yet. &ldquo;I imagine that this can be ported pretty easily to the new FSE interface if I happen to get enough users to keep it going,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Finding someone who knows the new system and is a freelancer is next to impossible, so I thought why not test the idea the old way.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, the plugin does its job pretty well, and most users still rely on the customizer. There is still plenty of time to figure out the rest.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 00:14:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"WPTavern: WordPress Global Community Sponsorship Program Will Not Include WordCamps for 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=124018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:209:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-global-sponsorship-program-will-not-include-wordcamps-for-2022?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-global-sponsorship-program-will-not-include-wordcamps-for-2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4603:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/10/08/proposal-2022-global-community-sponsorship-program/\">proposal</a> for the 2022 Global Community Sponsorship program will not include funding for WordCamps again this year, due to the unpredictability of hosting in-person events. The pandemic continues to make conditions unfavorable in many areas of the world where WordCamp and meetup organizers have opted to continue with virtual events. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, the Global Community Sponsorship program has offered multiple tiers of funding in support of official, volunteer-organized WordPress community events. In 2020, before the program was <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/07/23/moving-forward-with-online-events/\">suspended</a>, global sponsorship tiers ranged from $40,000 &ndash; $160,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated proposal knocks sponsorships back to a single annual package, billed at $10,000 USD per quarter. Sponsor benefits are similar to those offered in 2021. While the base package does not include WordCamp sponsorship, program participants can offer it by electing to pay an add-on, which is also billed quarterly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The proposed change for 2022 is that Global Sponsors who add on sponsorship for WordCamps will support&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;WordCamps (as opposed to choosing which WordCamps to sponsor a la carte), at the camp&rsquo;s top published level,&rdquo; WordPress.org community organizer Courtney Patubo Kranzke said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;In short, there would not be a community grant as we&rsquo;ve had in the past, but WordCamps will get credited global sponsorship funds at the top local level.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patubo Kranzke said that volunteer engagement is currently low and the single package ensures sponsors have a centralized point of contact, as opposed to trying to coordinate with multiple teams of volunteer event organizers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the potential availability of add-on funds, the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/09/13/announcement-updated-guidelines-for-in-person-wordcamps/\">updated guidelines for in-person WordCamps</a> state that organizers must be prepared to raise 100% of the expenses for their events. They are encouraged to keep their camps&rsquo; budgets lean with free or low cost venues that are fully refundable just in case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The expectation is in-person camps have to be able to cover all costs,&rdquo; Community team contributor Kevin Cristiano said. &ldquo;The global program will bring some relief to local organizers, but more so create a safety net for the entire program. What do I mean a safety net? We are navigating a world with risks on events like never before and we simply cannot afford another round of cancellations and lost deposits. It is our hope that once finalized the Global program can help bring stability and mitigate risks so we can have WordCamps begin in person again while being financially responsible.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress community events have been cut back significantly over the past two years. In 2019, local communities hosted 140 WordCamps and 805 WordPress meetup groups met more than 5,900 times. After the pandemic hit in 2020, the community hosted 31 WordCamps, most of which were held online. Meetup groups fell to 745 and met over 4,900 times. At the time of publishing in 2021, there have been just 14 WordCamps (all online) and 755 meetup groups met 2,400+ times. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the community team <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-opens-applications-for-in-person-wordcamps\">re-opening applications for in-person WordCamps,</a> all the remaining WordCamps on the books for 2021 have been scheduled as online events. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In anticipation of returning to in-person events, WordPress Community Support has added a &ldquo;communicable disease liability coverage&rdquo; policy to its event insurance. Any in-person WordCamp that proceeds to the ticketing stage will have <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/10/11/legal-protections-for-organizers/\">a disclaimer on the purchase page</a>, aimed at protecting organizers against claims related to COVID-19.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/10/08/proposal-2022-global-community-sponsorship-program/\">proposal</a> for the 2022 Global Community Sponsorship program is still under discussion until October 15, and will be finalized by October 28, so WordPress can recruit sponsors by the end of the year.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 03:10:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: Dynamic Social Images for Plugins, Themes, and Patterns?

You get mere seconds to impress those who happen upon your posts promoting your latest project. You must also pack a lot of information into a small window that would potentially draw in an array of different users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has not been doing any favors for plugin and theme authors who share links to their directory-hosted extensions. Social cards for them include a simple image, title, and description. Instead, WordPress.org could dynamically generate the social images by populating them with other data, such as ratings, active installs, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is just what GiveWP co-founder Matt Cromwell <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5926\">proposed today in a new ticket</a>. &ldquo;When plugin/theme/block/pattern authors want to share their work on social platforms, they want to link directly to their product on .org and have it look nice,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He shared an image of an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GiveWP/status/1447964733747908622\">earlier tweet</a> from the GiveWP Twitter account today:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The goal is to piggyback off the concept that GitHub put in motion over the summer. In June, the platform launched a new <a href=\"https://github.blog/2021-06-22-framework-building-open-graph-images/\">framework for building Open Graph images</a>. The system generates an on-the-fly image with data specific to a repository, issue, pull request, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the context of WordPress plugins, themes, and patterns, there are bits of information that could help highlight the projects:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Contributors (plugins only)</li><li>Locales/Translations</li><li>Rating</li><li>Installs</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This data is readily available on WordPress.org. All that would really be required is the code for generating the social images with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cromwell shared a mockup of what this might look like for a plugin, which is also available through the <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/ZAggnVZ5bk0W27ihzQGdWt/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1\">Figma project</a> he created:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Mockup for a plugin&rsquo;s generated social image.\n\n\n\n<p>He also has an annotated version:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Annotated version of social image mockup.\n\n\n\n<p>Thus far, the feedback has been positive in the ticket. This is probably one of those easy wins that most people in the community could get behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d only add that I&rsquo;d love this to be automatically translated,&rdquo; said Jean-Baptiste Audras <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5926#comment:4\">in the ticket</a>. &ldquo;Which seems doable given the language/locale is provided by the URL.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is to use the translated text for the generated image if the shared link is from one of the many locale-specific subdomains on WordPress.org. So, a Spanish URL would use the existing Spanish translation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We could even apply this concept to other pages on WordPress.org, particularly those that might not have an image associated with them. This is a treatment that Courtney Engle Robertson, Web Design and Developer Advocate at GoDaddy, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mathetos/posts/10223954958280286?comment_id=10223955011961628\">requested on Cromwell&rsquo;s Facebook post</a> about the idea. Workshops on the Learn section of the site, for example, could display the number of languages or length, so potential visitors have more information before clicking a link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best thing about this idea is that the WordPress community likely already has the foundational code to make this happen. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-social-image-generator-plugin-plans-to-integrate-with-jetpack\">Automattic purchased</a> Daniel Post&rsquo;s Social Image Generator plugin last month. The plan is to bundle the feature in Jetpack as part of its social media tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Generated image using dynamic data.\n\n\n\n<p>With a bit of custom code, it is not a stretch to think we could have better social images in short order. The plugin was already built with customization in mind when I <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/create-per-post-social-media-images-with-the-social-image-generator-wordpress-plugin\">reviewed it in June</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 23:52:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: WordPress.org Profiles Now Show Activity for Contributions Made on GitHub\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=124100\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:211:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-profiles-now-show-activity-for-contributions-made-on-github?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-org-profiles-now-show-activity-for-contributions-made-on-github\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3263:\"<p>WordPress.org profiles got an <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2021/10/11/wordpress-org-profiles-now-show-github-activity/\">update</a> over the weekend that will make them a better reflection of contributors&rsquo; efforts on GitHub. Users can now authorize GitHub to detect their activity on the WordPress GitHub organization and display it on their profiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p><br />&ldquo;Currently we&rsquo;re tracking New Issues submitted (by you), Closed Issues (by you), Pull requests submitted (by you), Pull requests merged (by you, and additionally the PR submitter gets a &lsquo;PR Merged&rsquo; event), and finally Pushes to default branches,&rdquo; WordPress lead developer Dion Hulse said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few reasons why one&rsquo;s contributions might not be visible after linking accounts. The meta team has not built an importer for all previous issues and pull requests, so WordPress.org only has data from last Friday and onwards. Early adopters who linked their accounts when the feature was first being tested may need to re-authenticate since the earlier version had <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/05/03/expired-github-and-wordpress-org-profile-connections/\">expired connections</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Linking accounts will help make it easier for the WordPress project to track contributions across multiple locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;In recent releases, the process of collecting props for non-WordPress.org contributions (namely&nbsp;Gutenberg) has been highly manual and error prone, occasionally resulting in contributors not receiving proper credit,&rdquo; Jonathan Desrosiers said when rolling out the first version of the app in March 2020. &ldquo;Connecting your WordPress.org and GitHub accounts will allow automatic tooling to be built which reduces the burden on release teams to maintain a credit list.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users who want to have their profiles include GitHub activity can navigate to the <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/profile/edit/group/1\">Edit Profile page on WordPress.org</a>, launch the app, and authorize their accounts with one click. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hulse is collecting feedback regarding adding more events (i.e. commenting on issues/PRs), combining events (i.e. Submitted &amp; Merged), and anything else that might improve the quality of activity tracked. Riad Benguella suggested adding a selector to filter the timeline by activity type. Hulse responded that the way profiles are currently set up, querying specific activities cannot currently be done in a performant way but that there are meta trac tickets (<a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/479\">#479</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/518\">#518</a>) where they are discussing a broader overhaul for profiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a great deal more activity coming in from GitHub, the ability to filter these activities might make WordPress.org a more comprehensive tool for assessing job candidates or verifying Five for the Future contributions.

Chishkala rê bóng xuống biên trái, vượt qua Minh Trí, rồi sút chìm chéo góc hạ gục thủ môn Văn Ý.
